1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,090
Okay, I think it's time to get things underway.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:12,620
It's Friday morning, 26th of April, with the magic number ten.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,490
2488. As you know, the final homework assignment for this module is due by the end of today.

4
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,380
Welcome to ask questions about that either here or in office hours this afternoon.

5
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,600
There were some questions asked after yesterday's tutorial.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,610
Nothing that seemed to really raise clarifications that are needed in general, but feel free to.

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:50,890
Shout out here and now. Otherwise, the plan for today will be to continuing to focus on quantum gases.

8
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:58,110
Looking especially at the equations of state that bring together all of their emergent macroscopic phenomena.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
And doing that first for the photon gas,

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:12,120
and then start developing the derivation of the behaviour of gases of fermions, looking at a different regime.

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,240
So rather than massless ultra relativistic photons,

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:28,140
look at relatively heavy non-relativistic fermions and see how well see the full range of behaviour for quantum gases in the grand canonical ensemble.

13
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,100
So the. Place that we wrapped up on Tuesday.

14
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,090
We focus on that photon gas and a couple of fun applications.

15
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:53,290
So we derived the Planck spectrum that describes the wavelength dependence of the energies of a gas of photons.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:04,610
We saw how. This Planck spectrum gives a perhaps surprisingly good description of the spectrum of solar radiation coming from the sun.

17
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,260
Uh, despite all of the complicated molecular physics that is responsible for the emission of those photons from the sun,

18
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,110
to a very good approximation, they can be treated as a non-interacting ideal photon gas.

19
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,100
And there was similar story, in fact,

20
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,660
with even better agreement between this Planck spectrum and the energies of the cosmic microwave background leftover from the Big Bang,

21
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,920
which we looked at a little bit more in yesterday's tutorial.

22
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,510
Where we ended on Tuesday was.

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,190
Integrating over this flank spectrum, um, integrating all frequencies.

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,830
And finding the overall average internal energy of the photon gas.

25
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,760
It's expectation value. That was.

26
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,960
Given by a very fun integral involving products of the Euler gamma function and Riemann zeta function.

27
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,220
Along with factors of Planck's constant, the speed of light,

28
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,700
and the functional dependence on the volume that the gas occupies and the fourth power of its temperature.

29
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:23,910
Where if we plug in specific values for the gamma function evaluated at four is three, factorial is six.

30
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,970
And the Riemann zeta function evaluated at four is pi to the fourth over 90.

31
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,410
So all together can cancel out two factors of pi.

32
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,890
And we ended up with that particular pre factor on that v t to the fourth.

33
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:52,560
Functional dependence. So any questions about what we've done with the photon gas of the Planck spectrum so far to get up to this point.

34
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,950
If not the next step that.

35
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,210
Would be interesting to consider is how this internal energy.

36
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:14,800
Compares with what we got earlier for ideal gases in the case of classical.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,570
Non-relativistic particles in the canonical ensemble.

38
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:31,860
So. The. Result for the average internal energy in that case, which we applied to.

39
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:42,200
So one of damage cycles was. A very simple relation between the energy expectation value and the temperature.

40
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,590
That just involved the number of particles and a constant numerical factor of three halves.

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,350
If we want to. Come up with some similar relation between energy and particle number.

42
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,189
Now that we are in the grand canonical context, for, what we need to do is actually compute the particle number,

43
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,990
which is no longer a fixed input characterising the system.

44
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:17,070
But in the grand canonical case, it is another large scale derived quantity on the same footing as the average internal energy.

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:30,220
And you may recall from before the break, or look up in your notes that from the grand canonical potential, the logarithm of the partition function,

46
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:41,200
just taking a derivative with respect to the chemical potential with a negative sign will give us this average photon number.

47
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,230
And as we talked about both earlier this week and last week, um,

48
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,590
this might take you by surprise because we have set Mu to be exactly zero for a photon gas.

49
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:03,460
So what we need to do is consider the grand canonical potential as a function of both temperature and chemical potential,

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,210
and then set mu to zero as the final step.

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,520
After taking this derivative and computing a more general expression for the average number of particles.

52
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,460
So without further ado, let's do that calculation. Again.

53
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,700
Probably something you won't have memorised,

54
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:32,060
but can look up from your notes or the lecture notes as the form of the grand canonical potential that we can plug into.

55
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,080
This derivative. It had a factor of VTI.

56
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,560
Speed of light cubed and pi squared, with a negative sign coming along.

57
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,860
From the derivative, and I'm going to move inside the integral over frequencies.

58
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:58,290
The only dependence on chemical potential in the grand canonical.

59
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,340
Potential shows up inside this integral.

60
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,630
Where we have a logarithm of one minus the usual grand canonical exponential.

61
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,550
Factor E to the minus beta times energy minus mu, which I broken up here.

62
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,440
To make it clearer how this mu is going to come about or come out.

63
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:32,850
So. This is not a hard derivative to do.

64
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,960
The derivative of a log starts with one over the arguments of that log.

65
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,120
And then we chain rule it a time or two.

66
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,510
The omega squared comes along for the ride. We have a negative exponential.

67
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,530
Of beta hbar omega hbar omega being the energy.

68
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,380
An exponential of beta mu. And then chain rule again gives us the beta coming from the arguments of that exponential.

69
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,640
So the beta is going to cancel out the temperature.

70
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:14,080
We have two negative signs that cancel out. We are still integrating over frequencies.

71
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:24,250
And at this point. The derivative has been taken, and we are free to impose the vanishing chemical potential that we have for the photon gas,

72
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:33,300
which will simplify this result. At least in terms of how much we have to write.

73
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,650
So integrating over all frequencies, we have an omega squared.

74
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:50,640
And if we divide through by the remaining exponential factors we have an exponential beta h bar omega minus one.

75
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,540
The Omega.

76
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:04,210
Which is looking somewhat like the the Bose-Einstein statistics we've seen before with this exponential factor minus one in the denominator.

77
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,360
So changing variables to. Emphasise that beta hbar omega.

78
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,670
Integrating over the argument of the exponential instead of over just the frequency itself.

79
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:30,840
We'll bring out. So from omega squared D omega we will have three factors of one over h bar beta which is beta is the inverse temperature.

80
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,100
So one over beta is the temperature over h bar all cubed.

81
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:45,480
And then another. Integral similar to what we had on Tuesday for the energy.

82
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:59,100
Only difference now is the power of x in the numerator here, rather than x cubed, we have x squared and the actual result is just as delightful.

83
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:08,280
This integral exactly evaluates to the Euler gamma function of three times the Riemann zeta function of three,

84
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,790
which is two factorial times a complicated, um, irrational number.

85
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,020
So I'll just leave this as two zeta three,

86
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:29,190
and we can see that this whole calculation has only differed from the computation of the photon internal energy,

87
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:42,000
photon gas internal energy that we did last time by a different number of omegas in our integral, along with a different number of h bars.

88
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,860
Um, the energy is exactly the same functional form up to an additional factor of h bar omega, which makes sense.

89
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:57,030
It is essentially counting how much energy each particle has and integrating over that, whereas this is just,

90
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,990
uh, counting the number of particles without bringing along an extra factor of the energy for the ride.

91
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,570
So moving on to. A new page and.

92
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,280
Writing down this final result with all. Factors of.

93
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,510
Feet are accounted for. We have this two Zeta three over.

94
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:40,800
Pi squared. Planck's constant cubed c cubed multiplied by the volume.

95
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:51,820
See there is actual screen volume in t cubed, which in terms of functional form is.

96
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,140
Or exhibits the same relation that we saw in the classical, non-relativistic canonical case.

97
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:13,240
The number of particles is just proportional to the average internal energy divided by t, and go from v t to the fourth to v t cubed.

98
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:25,520
And. We have the same sort of relation that we had before.

99
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,240
That the average internal energy is proportional.

100
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:42,970
To the particle number times the single power of the temperature, which we can justify just on dimensional grounds.

101
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:52,510
What's interesting is the constant of proportionality in this relation that was just three halves for a classical gas.

102
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,310
Now with a photon gas obeying. Quantum statistics.

103
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:15,590
It's a bit more complicated. So the relation between energy and volume times two to the fourth has this pi squared over 15 h bar s cubed c cubed.

104
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:27,970
And then to take. The cubed out of that vat to the fourth and replace that with the.

105
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:38,220
Number of photons gives us the inverse. Of the result that we just computed.

106
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,830
So there are some cancellations in particular, all these factors of HMRC which are just,

107
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,690
uh, unit conversion factors that we could have said equal to one at the start.

108
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,370
Those all cancel out and we are left with pi to the fourth over 30 Zeta three.

109
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:10,900
Which. We could rewrite in a suggestive way instead of combining everything into 30.

110
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,910
We can keep it as 90 over six times two.

111
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:25,480
And this is worth writing in this way, because it can get get us back to the ultimate origin of all of these factors,

112
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,010
which are these fun combinations of gamma functions.

113
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:41,400
And zeta functions, which, if we were to plug in all of the irrational values that we have, is about 2.7.

114
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,540
So not quite double the three halves that we had for classical non-relativistic particles.

115
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,590
So 1.5 going up to 2.7.

116
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:03,719
But the functional form this relation between energy and particle number remains the same just with an adjustment to the

117
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:12,900
coefficients reflecting the different physics and the different statistics of the photons that we are now working with.

118
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:37,130
Any questions about that general result? Something similar will now happen if we go on to look at the full equation of state.

119
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:43,250
So the classical equation of state that we've dealt with before the break was the ideal gas law.

120
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,420
Pressure times volume equals the number of particles times the temperature.

121
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:56,960
And just as we had that same functional relation with just an adjustment in the constant of proportionality between the two sides of that equation,

122
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:04,490
we can expect or hope to see a similar equation of state for photons, um,

123
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:10,760
a relation between pressure times volume and the average number of photons times the temperature.

124
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:19,400
In order to derive that, we need the pressure, and we need in fact to do.

125
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,030
Uh. Get used to the idea that even these massless photons.

126
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:33,780
So particles of light can in fact exert a pressure that is coming from our usual definition.

127
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,480
It's known as the radiation pressure. Treating photons or lights.

128
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:54,320
As a form of massless radiation. It is defined in the same way that we define pressure in the context of the canonical ensemble.

129
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,260
How the average internal energy depends on the volume.

130
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:11,049
If we impose constant entropy. And this radiation pressure is actually a big part of what keeps stars from collapsing.

131
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:21,280
So the sun and the other stars that we considered earlier this week have outward radiation pressure balancing the inward force of gravity that,

132
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:30,370
if left unchecked, would want to collapse all of that matter down to a single point modulo the effects of.

133
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:43,890
General relativity and quantum gravity. So the first step to taking this derivative and computing the radiation pressure.

134
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,600
Based on the result that we had on Tuesday, is checking the condition of constant entropy.

135
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,130
And seeing what constraints that imposes.

136
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,370
On the form of the energy that we take the derivative of.

137
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:17,480
And the most straightforward way to determine the entropy is by using the relation between entropy.

138
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,270
Uh, free energy or the, uh, grand canonical potential.

139
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:31,630
The land of free energy and the internal energy. So this is analogous to what we did in the canonical.

140
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,700
Ensemble for classical particles.

141
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:45,960
We just need to actually evaluate this grand canonical potential that up until now, we have also left as an integral over frequencies.

142
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:55,710
So writing down. The grand canonical potential, again with no derivative.

143
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,580
Over chemical potential, and with that chemical potential set to zero as appropriate for the photon gas.

144
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:15,500
Our usual change of variables to x being beta h bar omega brings out the usual factors of.

145
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,220
T cubed over. Hbar cubed.

146
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:32,760
And the integral becomes x squared times log of one minus e to the minus x dx x.

147
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:47,360
This, not too surprisingly, is yet another in those families of poly logarithmic integrals that all have these fun relations to zeta functions.

148
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,470
In this case, it's not quite as elegant. It's and minus two times zeta of four.

149
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,600
That's the same zeta four that we had in the energy pi to the fourth over 90.

150
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:07,710
So this integral. In the end is minus pi to the fourth over 45.

151
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,640
So plugging that in to the expression for the.

152
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:24,380
Entropy of the photon gas. If we divide the internal energy by a factor of t, we have v t cubed in both terms,

153
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,650
which is good because we want them to have the same dimension so that they can be subtracted to give us the entropy.

154
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,270
Both terms also have the pi squared over h bar cubed c cubed.

155
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,370
Coming from. This family of integrals.

156
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:53,970
And then the energy had go back from Tuesday a factor of one over 15.

157
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:10,020
Um, multiplying those constant factors. And we've just found that the grand canonical potential has a negative sign that cancels and a one over 45,

158
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:19,290
which, if we put everything together, is v cubed times four pi squared over 45.

159
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:31,350
Hbar cubed C cubed. What we really care about here, in the context of the radiation pressure, is the condition of constant entropy, which is now.

160
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,880
The requirement that this combination of factors volume times temperature cubed.

161
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,730
Has to stay. Constant, which we can.

162
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,440
Just rearrange into a relation between the temperature and the volume.

163
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:04,510
So with this B being some constant, the entropy is constant when the temperature varies like one over the cube root of the volume,

164
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:14,950
which if we think all the way back to when we did this for the canonical ensemble in classical gases before the break,

165
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,490
what we had there, the condition of constant entropy was volume times temperature to the three halves power.

166
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,850
And this relation between temperature and volume had another factor of two v to the minus two thirds.

167
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:35,350
So we are seeing already a difference in the photon gas compared to earlier non-relativistic work.

168
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:50,680
But if we plug in four powers of the temperature into the internal energy whose derivative we need to take, we will get the radiation pressure.

169
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,090
Minus pi squared over 15 hbar cubed c cubed.

170
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,320
And then the derivative of volume times.

171
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,960
Be to the fourth times. Volume to the minus four thirds leaves at the end.

172
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,800
An overall one over cube root of the volume.

173
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,740
When we take the derivative with respect to v, we get.

174
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:31,390
All of this back out again, just with a factor of minus one over three of the minus sign.

175
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,190
We'll cancel that one out front. So there's a one over three V.

176
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Times all the constants that. Just come along for the ride.

177
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,590
Be to the fourth. Due to the minus third which we can recognise as well the.

178
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,500
Internal energy. We were taking the derivative of in the first place.

179
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,460
With a factor of one over three. The out front.

180
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,780
And we are now starting to see something that looks like an equation of state.

181
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:16,290
You move the volume to the other side. We have the radiation pressure times the volume of the photon gas.

182
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,800
Is one third the average internal energy.

183
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:32,660
One fun thing we can do is recognise one third as the ratio of two factorial over three factorial, which is.

184
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:40,890
In turn, the ratio of gamma functions evaluated at three divided by that at four.

185
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:53,730
And this is useful because of the constant factor that we have relating the internal energy to the number of photons times the temperature.

186
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,580
Gamma four. Zeta four over gamma three.

187
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,120
Zeta three. So there's some cancellations in there.

188
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,889
And we end up with. Overall.

189
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,050
Zeta to the fourth over Zeta sorry, 90 to the fourth Zeta of four over Zeta of three.

190
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:27,480
That's Pi. To the fourth over 90 to 3.

191
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,940
And false number of photons times the temperature. So the functional form.

192
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,530
Look is, uh, equivalent to the ideal gas law.

193
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:51,510
The classical PV equals empty. We just now have again, a different constant factor out front pi to the fourth over 90 Zeta three.

194
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,000
Numerically, this is not actually that far from the classical one.

195
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:07,920
It is about 0.9. Um, to, well, so 10% away from the classical case.

196
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,150
This is the photon gas equation of state.

197
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,240
The same functional form as the ideal gas law.

198
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,180
Just as we saw with the relation between energy and particle number,

199
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:40,510
a different constant factor resulting from the different quantum statistics of photons compared to classical particles.

200
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,020
So that is. One of the equations of state that we were after today.

201
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,130
And that is where we will wrap up with the photon gas.

202
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:02,250
So. We have 20 minutes before a brief break to change gears and start looking at fermion gases.

203
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:14,940
Before we do that, a last chance for questions or comments about photons applying spectrum and the equation to state that we have in the end.

204
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:37,710
Not seeing any. It's time for something new. She will be still looking at ideal, non-interacting gases.

205
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:47,960
Now consisting of. Fermionic particles, and maybe a paradigmatic fermion to have in mind.

206
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,920
Um. We'll be. Electrons.

207
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,910
So those are, um, fermions that are crucial constituents of matter.

208
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:09,650
And one place they behave like a gas is actually in metals, solid materials.

209
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,460
Electrons are able to move about metals freely.

210
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:19,610
This is called electrical conduction. Um, and they can be treated as gases.

211
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:32,300
They do have interactions. But as an idealised example we can neglect those and see how well we reproduce behaviours of metals.

212
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,720
As well as other solids that are built of atoms that contain electrons.

213
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:46,960
Now, you can remember that the big difference between fermions and bosons is the Pauli exclusion principle.

214
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,890
Energy levels for fermions can only ever be unoccupied or singly occupied.

215
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:01,660
Unlike bosonic particles that can have any number of particles in each energy level.

216
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:12,790
The consequence of this is working with Fermi-Dirac statistics rather than Bose-Einstein statistics, and in practice.

217
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:24,370
The difference between those two sets of quantum statistics is different locations of negative signs in the

218
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,480
grand canonical partition function and the corresponding grand canonical potential a minus T out front,

219
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,630
and a relative plus sign between one and the exponential factor within the logarithm.

220
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,100
So having done ultra relativistic bosons for the photon gas, let's.

221
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:55,550
Make this as big a change as possible to cover as many different options as we can without going through each and every one of them in full detail.

222
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:08,570
Let's head back to. The non-relativistic particles that we considered for the classical physics in the canonical ensemble.

223
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:18,640
So this gives us the relation between the energy and the quantised momenta that.

224
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,300
We have seen, you know, a couple of times.

225
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:32,600
Planck's constant squared times pi squared over twice the mass of the fermions times the length of the volume that they are in,

226
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:41,270
so the linear length squared, the volume itself is L cubed, and then in each of the three space dimensions.

227
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,200
We have integer units of momenta.

228
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,010
Okay.

229
00:30:49,370 --> 00:31:05,180
That gets squared to give us the energy p squared over to m these k x k y k z start at one and can go arbitrarily high from there and altogether.

230
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,800
This inner product is just going to be the scalar k squared.

231
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:22,650
So if we plug in these energy levels and the corresponding energies into.

232
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:31,090
The grand canonical partition saw a great canonical potential for Fermi-Dirac statistics.

233
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:39,860
We have. A temperature.

234
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:49,130
We have now sums over these integer three vectors and inside the logarithm.

235
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,340
The argument to the exponential takes a more complicated form.

236
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:09,030
Minus. Hbar squared pi squared k squared over two and l squared times the temperature with that beta mu.

237
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,780
Coming along for the ride and out front I've left a little gap here because we

238
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:22,380
will again have degenerates or degeneracy among all of these energy levels.

239
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,700
For each momentum vector k there will be.

240
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:37,320
Two. Energy levels with the same k and the same energy.

241
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,480
In the case of photons, those are the two polarisations that we talked about a bit yesterday.

242
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:51,630
In the case of the fermions that we are considering, like electrons, this factor of two comes from a different property,

243
00:32:53,490 --> 00:33:02,550
which is known as spin, which I will put in quotation marks because these fermions are not actually spinning.

244
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,880
They just have some angular momentum that behaves as though they were spinning.

245
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,070
So for every. Momentum vector.

246
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:20,600
We have so-called spin up and spin down varieties of that fermion with exactly the same energy.

247
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:31,900
And this is the this full form of the grand canonical potential, similar to where we started off with photons,

248
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:42,640
is not really convenient to work with infinite sums over integer three vectors, so we want to simplify it to carry out approximate analyses.

249
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:51,460
And what are these simplifications that we can do. Is the same that we did for the photon gas.

250
00:33:54,030 --> 00:34:02,820
And this is to, instead of sum, integrate over continuously varying momenta k hat.

251
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:15,410
Also the same set of steps in the same argument that we went through in the classical case,

252
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:25,680
going from sums over discrete energy levels to integrals over continuous.

253
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:32,350
You know, k x, y z. All positive.

254
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:42,060
And as for photons. We will integrate over spherical coordinates.

255
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,060
And these will be confined to the positive octant of the sphere.

256
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:58,469
So a quick visualisation of this octant.

257
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:04,170
Just something we will come back to probably after the break at noon,

258
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,900
is essentially replacing this cube of energy levels with integration over this eighth of a sphere.

259
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,670
Um, that we can see roughly matches.

260
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:33,860
We'll come back to this a bit later on to discuss more precisely how closely it matches and what we can do about the mismatches.

261
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:42,410
For now, though, we can remember that the angular integrals in spherical coordinates.

262
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:49,700
Instead of giving us four pi for the full surface of the sphere 360 degrees, just give us one eighth of that.

263
00:35:49,700 --> 00:36:02,000
So a pi over two from the positive octant. So our grand canonical potential is now the twos cancel.

264
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,880
We have negative pi times the temperature integrating.

265
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:19,600
Over k squared. From the spherical coordinates and then this logarithm.

266
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:27,100
Involving now k squared. As well.

267
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:40,400
And including the chemical potential which is no longer vanishing.

268
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:52,320
For non-relativistic fermions. And if we change variables to work in terms of.

269
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,420
The continuous energy rather than this continuous k hat.

270
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:16,720
Then this gets a bit more. Elegant so we can remember the energy is just k squared over two m times.

271
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,220
Constant factors.

272
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:30,220
Rearranging that k itself or k hat in this case will be those constant factors with the square root times the square root of that energy.

273
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,760
So the specific factors that we can read off are.

274
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,830
L squared with a square root is just L. There's a square root of M and square roots of pi squared h bar squared.

275
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:58,080
Leave us pi and h bar. And I'll put the square root of the two in with the square root of the energy, the DQ in the integral.

276
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:05,110
Just involves the derivative of the square root of e that we have here.

277
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:14,410
We go down one unit in power. We get E to the minus one half, which is one over the square root of E, all the constant factors.

278
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,720
Come along for the ride and the one half power.

279
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:30,500
Um, we'll cancel out that square root and leave us with a square root to the denominator as well.

280
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,630
So the expressed in terms of the energy.

281
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,240
Yeah. Let me shift this down a bit further in the page.

282
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,200
What we have is. Minus pi t times.

283
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,660
So three factors of these.

284
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,870
This constant ratio coming from the k hat squared and the d k.

285
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:04,290
So l root m pi and h bar all cubed.

286
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:17,920
Limits of integration remain the same. And the cat squared just then leaves us with two e in the integral.

287
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,510
The log of one plus.

288
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:32,320
And this is where we get the real simplification going from k f squared to energy absorbs everything but the t.

289
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,980
In. The exponential factor. Let me just get back to the usual.

290
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,970
Exponential of minus beta times energy minus mu.

291
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,680
And this is all being integrated over energies.

292
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,320
And. Simplifying the slightly.

293
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:02,300
You can see that I wrote down V what I meant to write t the v comes from having l cubed.

294
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,850
The tea is still there. The.

295
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:22,110
Factors of two, which I missed. One here coming from D over route two E, so we have overall a square root of two.

296
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,450
We have three square roots of the fermion mass along with.

297
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,710
Two factors of pi. So pi cubed with a pi that cancels out one of those factors.

298
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,790
Three factors of Planck's constant and then the integral over.

299
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:58,530
The logarithm of one plus exponential. With a square root Eddie at the end.

300
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:09,030
So that is progress compared to the complicated sum over integer three vectors that we started off with.

301
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,730
It's still not the easiest integral to evaluate.

302
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,820
So the next simplification that we will do.

303
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:33,600
For this analysis will be to try to make this a bit simpler, and also be motivated by taking us away from the classical regime.

304
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:40,260
So looking at the brain to create a spread of physical behaviour.

305
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:49,820
That we can consider. And that is to say, the classical regime is based in the high temperature limit.

306
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:56,030
So getting far from that if I want to see how.

307
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,260
These results simplify. If we consider low temperatures.

308
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:14,630
Far from that classical limit. And to make things a bit more concrete.

309
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,810
Let's. Instead of working directly with the grand canonical potential,

310
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:27,440
work with something a bit more physical and apply this simplification, at least at first.

311
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,650
Looking at. The average.

312
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,130
Uh. Density of particles.

313
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,220
So the ratio of the particle number for this fermion gas divided by the volume.

314
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:55,060
This is the same derivative with respect to the chemical potential that we started off with today.

315
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,110
And what this gives us we can just.

316
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,300
Evaluate it without re copying.

317
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,980
The Chemical Society, the grand canonical potential that we have up here,

318
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:20,630
the derivative of the log within the integral over energies, bring us down this argument again.

319
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:32,150
We have. Then a chain rule bringing us now with a positive sign, our exponential factor.

320
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:41,890
And then the argument of that exponential with the root Eddie coming along for the ride temperature,

321
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:48,110
an inverse temperature cancelling and dividing through by that exponential factor.

322
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:56,910
We have. An integral over.

323
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:13,130
Something that looks like. The kind of occupation, average occupation number that we saw when we first arrived.

324
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:22,340
Fermi-Dirac statistics one over exponential plus one rather than one over exponential, minus one for Bose-Einstein statistics.

325
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,840
And then a root eddy left at the end.

326
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:40,270
And what we can do with this is. Pull out this exponential or exponentially dependent factor and to find that to be.

327
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,600
Something analogous to the Planck spectrum.

328
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,550
So the plank spectrum was a description of how the energies of photons varied as a function of their frequency.

329
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:01,870
Here we have a description of how the number of fermions varies as a function of their energy.

330
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:11,830
So we integrate over what we will call a function f of e with the square root e d e.

331
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:23,080
Coming along for the ride. And we can read off pretty easily that this f of a function is just one over our exponential factor.

332
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:31,220
The plus sign there. So that looks like.

333
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,860
An average energy level occupation number in Fermi-Dirac directions.

334
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,990
And this is called.

335
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:54,460
The Fermi function in analogy to the Planck spectrum, and something that we can analyse on its own, sort of pulled out from its appearance in.

336
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,560
These predictions for larger scale properties like the average particle density.

337
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:09,860
One difference between the Fermi function and the Planck spectrum that you may have noticed is that these causal factors have fronts.

338
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,000
The mass cubed, pi squared and h bar cubed are not included.

339
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,220
So that just leaves the. Fermi function as essentially a pure number.

340
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:34,120
And if we think about what happens as the energy varies with respect to the chemical potential, we can map out the overall range of this function.

341
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:45,590
So if we. Let's see what I can fit on this page.

342
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:08,570
There's a few things to say about the ferry function, so I'll give myself space to put them without squeezing things.

343
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,950
If we assume a positive chemical potential.

344
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:23,270
So this is something that we will justify later, and also something that takes us further from the classical limit,

345
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,980
where the chemical potential goes to negative infinity as the temperature goes to infinity.

346
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,890
Then the Fermi function has a threshold.

347
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:44,450
Exactly when the energy is equal to the chemical potential that e minus mu cancels out in the exponential,

348
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:54,770
we get E to the zero is one, and the Fermi function as a whole is one half, and that is, while c is a half.

349
00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:04,280
Independent of the temperature, beta times zero is just zero for any any beta.

350
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:14,780
And this is a threshold because there is different behaviour on either side of it, which is not too hard to see when the energy is greater than mu.

351
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:26,060
The argument of the exponential is positive. So especially at low temperature, we have an exponentially enhanced denominator of the Fermi function,

352
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,880
which means that the Fermi function as a whole is exponentially suppressed.

353
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,220
And in particular it will go to zero.

354
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,639
But either the energy becomes very large or beta becomes very large.

355
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,350
The temperature becomes very low.

356
00:48:50,180 --> 00:49:01,100
And on the opposite side of this threshold, if the energy is less than mu, then the exponential itself e to a negative number becomes zero.

357
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,910
It becomes negligible compared to the one in the denominator.

358
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:13,820
For very well large differences between energy and chemical potential or low temperatures.

359
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:27,670
So the exponential itself goes away and the Fermi function will approach one over one from below.

360
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:34,330
So this is the range of behaviours that we can have for the Fermi function.

361
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:37,990
Just a number ranging between 0 and 1.

362
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:47,920
Um, and with a threshold when the energy is equal to the chemical potential.

363
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:56,650
Or to put this in another way that we will come back to after taking a bit of a break until noon.

364
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:05,560
If we express this as a ratio of energy over chemical potential, the threshold sets in or this ratio is one.

365
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,950
So we'll talk about this plot in full detail in about ten minutes.

366
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,670
But are there any questions about what we've done so far with fermions?

367
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,670
Before we take that break and reconvene at noon.

368
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,372
Not seeing any. I'll try to pause rather than stop that recording and just leave that up on the screen.

369
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:51,016
We can get back to it and say a bit more about the behaviour of the Fermi function that we have plotted here.

370
00:50:51,556 --> 00:51:00,196
So just to get the functional form into the same form as we're showing here,

371
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:16,666
plotted against the ratio of energy and chemical potential, we can write down that Fermi function as one over the exponential of.

372
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:22,056
Energy over chemical potential by pulling out.

373
00:51:23,176 --> 00:51:35,386
An overall factor of chemical potential and of temperature, so that E to the beta energy minus mu, we pull out a mu replace beta with one over T.

374
00:51:36,316 --> 00:51:40,726
This is the form it takes. There's a plus one in the denominator.

375
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:47,656
And. If we recall properties of exponentials with this product of um.

376
00:51:50,696 --> 00:51:53,846
You over t times e over mu minus one.

377
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:57,596
We can turn that into.

378
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:11,386
The exponential factor of e over mu minus one raised to the power of mu over t, and that's essentially what is being shown in this figure.

379
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:15,496
We have this Fermi function versus e over mu.

380
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:23,296
So an e over mu equals one. That exponential vanishes for all powers depending on chemical potential and temperature.

381
00:52:24,046 --> 00:52:29,046
And we always get that one half. That, uh, we computed.

382
00:52:30,036 --> 00:52:33,456
So for all temperatures, there is an intersection there at a half.

383
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:40,986
And as the temperature gets lower. Well, the two things can happen either.

384
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:47,886
The Fermi function decreases to zero or increases to one,

385
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:56,976
and we can see that this increase is happening more and more quickly depending on this ratio of chemical potential over temperature.

386
00:52:57,396 --> 00:53:02,496
So here it's unfortunately the inverse of the labels on these curves.

387
00:53:02,496 --> 00:53:07,626
But the red line is when mu over t equals one.

388
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:17,166
The dashed green line that is the next steepest going through a half has mu over t equal to a half.

389
00:53:18,326 --> 00:53:21,746
And then you look at a 10th and a hundredth.

390
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:25,226
For the dotted blue line and solid black line.

391
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:31,526
By the time we have a temperature that is 100 times lower than the chemical potential,

392
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:38,816
you can see there's a very rapid jump from the asymptotic limit for every function of one.

393
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:43,076
For lower energy is going down to zero at higher energies.

394
00:53:44,356 --> 00:53:48,586
So the takeaway from this plot and what we've seen by.

395
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:54,516
Or what we can see from the mathematics itself is that.

396
00:53:55,996 --> 00:54:07,806
The. The lower temperature that corresponds to the larger beta produces a faster approach to these asymptotic limits,

397
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:11,116
zero and one, depending on the temperature.

398
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:24,146
And this is, um, the justification for the simplification that we get from considering low temperatures.

399
00:54:24,746 --> 00:54:29,426
So I've been coy about what exactly has been simplified so far.

400
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:33,896
But what we can do for these very low temperatures.

401
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:41,106
Is actually. Approximate this Fermi function by.

402
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:49,746
A simpler function that will simplify the.

403
00:54:52,006 --> 00:55:00,496
Integrals it appears in. So the simplification itself will be to approximate.

404
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:08,446
The Fermi function f of e. As a step function.

405
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:17,486
So going this continuously from one for low energies to zero for high energies.

406
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:26,366
I remember that we always have non-negative energies.

407
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:32,646
Oh, and it didn't quite fit in there. I'm just going to rewrite this down here.

408
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:45,206
It's either 1 or 0, it's one. Whenever the non-negative energy is less than mu, it is zero otherwise.

409
00:55:47,686 --> 00:55:53,296
The special case of a half exactly at e equals mu is something.

410
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:59,416
It only happens at a point a set of measure zero. We don't have to worry about what's going on at that boundary.

411
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:06,016
What this does in the equation where we introduce this Fermi function.

412
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:11,626
So if we rewrite this particle number density.

413
00:56:17,596 --> 00:56:27,966
With all of its constant factors attached. We will have in this integral either 0 or 1.

414
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:36,996
So every. Um, part of the domain with an energy larger than mu will be killed off.

415
00:56:37,866 --> 00:56:41,076
So the approximation that we have.

416
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:57,676
Just limits the. Upper bound of integration, where f of t equals one, and all that is left is the square root of E itself.

417
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:02,236
And that is an integral that we are able to do without trouble.

418
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:11,856
It's even more you know, the troubling thing is to keep rewriting all these causal factors.

419
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:20,466
But integrating E to the one half will give us each of the three halves times one over that power is two thirds.

420
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:26,786
And this is evaluated from zero to mu and we end up with.

421
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:34,496
Three. Square roots of two. Three square roots of M and three square roots of the chemical potential mu.

422
00:57:35,276 --> 00:57:38,546
So all of those are raised to the three house power.

423
00:57:39,596 --> 00:57:43,826
And we have a three pi squared h bar cubed in the denominator.

424
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:52,166
So a simple zero temperature limit effectively of the particle density.

425
00:57:54,396 --> 00:58:03,636
Um. More formally, this result corresponds to a leading order of a low temperature expansion.

426
00:58:11,286 --> 00:58:20,945
More formally, an expansion that brings in powers of the temperature relative to the chemical potential as a small parameter to expand in.

427
00:58:20,946 --> 00:58:27,546
This is to limit where that temperature goes to zero, or equivalently, the chemical potential goes to infinity.

428
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:32,196
Um, this expansion is.

429
00:58:34,446 --> 00:58:38,106
Related to or known as a Summerfield expansion.

430
00:58:38,586 --> 00:58:42,126
Something that I think we will skip for the time being,

431
00:58:42,456 --> 00:58:48,306
but might come back to sort of around the end of the term, depending on how quickly we get through.

432
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:56,786
The big remaining topic on interacting systems, which we will get to not today, but next week.

433
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:04,796
The physical picture that we can have with this result.

434
00:59:06,236 --> 00:59:10,676
So in. The zero temperature limit.

435
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:16,156
We have seen previously. Um.

436
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:26,696
For low temperatures, a exponential enhancement for the relative probability of low energy energy levels,

437
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:32,616
so energy levels with low energy being occupied. Coming just from the the normal Boltzmann factor.

438
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:40,386
So what happens as the temperature goes to zero. But we have a Pauli exclusion principle in play is that.

439
00:59:41,406 --> 00:59:45,486
All of the low lying energy levels are.

440
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:51,706
Filled. But due to Pauli exclusion.

441
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:57,466
There can only be one fermion in each of those low energy levels.

442
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:05,456
So each of them is occupied with the maximum occupation number and sub l equals one.

443
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:14,906
I'll mention in passing. This is a simple example of a density of states, which came up in a question a week or two ago.

444
01:00:15,506 --> 01:00:19,076
Um, I won't say anything more about that here.

445
01:00:19,646 --> 01:00:23,516
This is essentially a step function for the density of states.

446
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:28,886
All states below a Cut-Off are occupied. All states above are unoccupied.

447
01:00:30,056 --> 01:00:33,656
And because the.

448
01:00:34,886 --> 01:00:41,106
Energies that we have for these energy levels are proportional to that momentum k squared.

449
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:47,276
In this non-relativistic case, the total number of particles.

450
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:54,326
Are effectively just filling that positive octant of the sphere.

451
01:00:56,496 --> 01:01:09,066
Going up to. The cut off on the energy given by the chemical potential turns into a cut off on the momentum,

452
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:17,586
which is just the square root of that energy, or equivalently, the square root of that chemical potential.

453
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:22,806
So this is the context in which this figure.

454
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:28,996
We can discuss in a bit more detail. This is from.

455
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:36,766
I took this from Schroders introduction to Thermal Physics where he uses lowercase in where we would use.

456
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,886
K is just a set of integers.

457
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:50,456
The energy levels that we have are positive integer values for each of these 3KX Kiki z.

458
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:57,326
So that is the set of black points in the middle of this cube.

459
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:04,586
We are approximating this with a sphere of radius k max, which is.

460
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:09,326
Um. We just said proportional to.

461
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:20,956
Square root of the chemical potential that sets the maximum energy of the particles,

462
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:27,106
or the maximum energy level that all the particles fill up at low temperatures.

463
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:38,236
And we can see that this approximation of these integer energy levels by spherical coordinates is bringing in two um.

464
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:48,876
Sets of disagreements. First, there is a deficit in three places where the sphere goes beyond.

465
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:55,016
The cube with. Maximum.

466
01:02:58,896 --> 01:03:04,386
Uh integer k. And then this is compensated by the other four corners.

467
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:07,986
So a small one down there from this perspective.

468
01:03:09,216 --> 01:03:26,045
But other places where. The integers would exceed this cube and all balance out up to effects that vanish like the surface area over the volume.

469
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:35,556
So like one over L or well, the l here is the integers k vanishes like one over the number of particles that we have.

470
01:03:36,036 --> 01:03:40,296
And in statistical physics we are always working with the large number of particles

471
01:03:40,296 --> 01:03:45,906
where this these spherical coordinates become that very good approximation.

472
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:52,266
And from filling an octant of a sphere with a radius root mu,

473
01:03:52,956 --> 01:04:01,836
we end up with the expectation that the number of particles goes like the volume of the sphere 4/3 pi r cubed over eight.

474
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:13,336
Which is where we get that square root mu cubed dependence from the radius of the sphere corresponding to the volume.

475
01:04:14,356 --> 01:04:20,556
I'll say in passing in modules on solid state physics, the sphere.

476
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:29,356
So the surface of the sphere, um, the boundary between occupied and unoccupied energy levels is known as the Fermi surface.

477
01:04:29,956 --> 01:04:32,655
That's a bit beyond what we will deal with in this module,

478
01:04:32,656 --> 01:04:38,895
but it's something you might have seen or heard before in other modules, either now or in the future.

479
01:04:38,896 --> 01:04:44,786
For those of you on, uh, master's programs. So that's a Fermi surface.

480
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:55,706
And the Fermi surface in our non-relativistic, non-interacting ideal gas case is a simple sphere.

481
01:04:55,856 --> 01:05:03,416
It's as simple as it can be. And there is one related bit of terminology.

482
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:09,926
So in this zero temperature limit where we have the sharp cut off between filled and empty energy levels.

483
01:05:11,836 --> 01:05:19,456
Maximum energy. Corresponding to that Cut-Off, so defining the Fermi surface of the sphere.

484
01:05:20,776 --> 01:05:29,606
Is known as the Fermi energy. So this will be just E sub f with no expectation values.

485
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:34,706
Well we've seen the threshold is just the energy equal to mu.

486
01:05:35,096 --> 01:05:39,566
So Fermi energy is a fancy word for the chemical potential.

487
01:05:41,216 --> 01:05:50,666
Which, if we rearrange our zero temperature result, the leading order term that survives, um, in this power series.

488
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:56,546
We can take the two thirds power of.

489
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:01,996
The particle density. And.

490
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:06,366
F over V along with that three.

491
01:06:07,816 --> 01:06:20,236
Pi squared factor. And then two thirds of H bar cubed and to M to the three halves will give us just h bar over.

492
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:27,346
To em. Um.

493
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:43,686
Each bar squared in fact. So this is the Fermi energy related to the particle density for these non-interacting fermions at zero temperature.

494
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:55,036
So any questions about the simplifications that we have done to get nice,

495
01:06:55,036 --> 01:07:03,616
elegant expressions for the zero temperature limit of this fermion gas, assuming a positive chemical potential.

496
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:11,026
Because if there aren't, I think you can guess what's coming next.

497
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:17,236
We go through the same procedure that we did for the photon gas, checking the average internal energy, uh,

498
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:25,616
relating that to the number of particles and considering the pressure and equation of state, we'll get at least a.

499
01:07:27,736 --> 01:07:30,736
Um, good bit of the way through that.

500
01:07:32,636 --> 01:07:38,726
In the remaining time today. Starting with the.

501
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:52,846
Internal energy. So just as we saw for the photon gas,

502
01:07:52,846 --> 01:07:58,456
the only difference between the integrals that we have to do for the particle number

503
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:05,596
versus the energy is just integrating over the energies carried by the particles versus.

504
01:08:07,456 --> 01:08:15,166
Integrating over the particles themselves. So compared to the calculation that we just did.

505
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:29,146
We only have to insert an extra factor of the energy into the integral over energies to get the overall internal energy of the photon gas.

506
01:08:33,996 --> 01:08:36,996
Which is to say, we have, as always.

507
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:42,756
Are two cubed or pi squared, each bar cubed.

508
01:08:43,776 --> 01:08:47,516
Now. With instead of.

509
01:08:49,946 --> 01:08:53,606
The Fermi function times the square root of energy. We have.

510
01:08:54,906 --> 01:09:00,096
An extra energy waiting. With that.

511
01:09:01,446 --> 01:09:11,086
Square root still there and the same. Low temperature simplification of a step function for the Fermi function.

512
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:19,306
Cuts off this integral as well. At the chemical potential mu.

513
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:28,456
It is just e to the three halves power d e again something with that we can do without any fuss.

514
01:09:30,846 --> 01:09:36,096
So. You have to mute the three halves as usual.

515
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:45,936
We have an extra factor of mu now coming from the five horsepower of that integral, and instead of two thirds, we have 2/5.

516
01:09:46,946 --> 01:09:52,386
Uh, multiplying that. So just replacing all the threes by fives and that expression.

517
01:09:54,936 --> 01:09:58,356
Pi squared and hbar cubed.

518
01:10:00,216 --> 01:10:09,306
And well because there is this, these similarities with to mu over hbar cubed pi squared.

519
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:13,746
We can bring in the particle number density.

520
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:21,036
And well, as I said, all the threes above were replaced by fives here.

521
01:10:21,056 --> 01:10:23,666
A factor of 3/5. We'll do that.

522
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:32,516
The extra mew comes along for the ride, and we have the particle number density accounting for all of the other factors in this expression.

523
01:10:33,726 --> 01:10:44,496
So this is more significantly different from the classical three halves empty than we had for the photon gas.

524
01:10:45,126 --> 01:10:50,796
Remember, for the photon gas today, we just had about 2.7 and T for the energy.

525
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:59,046
Now there is no T at all. Um, in part because we've sort of formally taken that t to zero limit.

526
01:10:59,746 --> 01:11:04,596
What's interesting is that this particle density and energy density are both nonzero.

527
01:11:05,786 --> 01:11:16,376
Even in the zero temperature limit, which is qualitatively different from what we found for classical particles or for the photon gas.

528
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:26,066
And we can just rearrange this slightly to see that.

529
01:11:28,396 --> 01:11:34,336
In this limit of absolute zero temperature, the average energy per particle.

530
01:11:38,136 --> 01:11:46,636
Is related to the ferry energy. So it is just.

531
01:11:48,026 --> 01:11:53,546
Ratio of these expectation values, the volumes cancel.

532
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:58,076
It's just this 3/5 mu factor. And that mu is.

533
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:12,206
The Fermi energy at zero temperature. So this is just related to that same physical picture we talked about for the particle number.

534
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:19,556
Because every energy level with low energies are filled on average the.

535
01:12:23,526 --> 01:12:32,466
The way that the number of energy levels depends on the value of their energy is such that we just get the overall upper limit,

536
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:37,236
the threshold for the boundary between filled and unfilled energy levels.

537
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:42,156
Again, all as a consequence of Pauli exclusion.

538
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:54,586
So they use the fermions are. Filling all of the low and all of the energy levels with low values of the energy.

539
01:13:00,536 --> 01:13:09,556
Going up to E.f. And that is why they cannot have zero energy even at absolute zero.

540
01:13:10,996 --> 01:13:16,876
Um, they cannot all collapse to an energy level that has zero energy by Pauli exclusion.

541
01:13:17,296 --> 01:13:27,346
They are continually forced to squeeze in as close as they can to zero, but still pushed away from it by the restrictions on the occupation numbers.

542
01:13:31,756 --> 01:13:39,076
So at this point. Now take a brief digression and touch on.

543
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:44,296
Yesterday's tutorial where I didn't.

544
01:13:45,406 --> 01:13:49,786
Well, I had too many things to talk about and didn't get through all of them.

545
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:54,536
And in particular, I promised that we would. Um.

546
01:13:56,846 --> 01:14:06,326
See in a bit more detail today. The final task for the current tutorial activity of looking at the heat capacity for,

547
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:13,645
um, models of a solid that don't explicitly invoke quantum mechanics,

548
01:14:13,646 --> 01:14:22,076
where we try to explain the experimental results for the behaviour of that heat capacity.

549
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:27,626
So here are those results again a.

550
01:14:29,776 --> 01:14:33,646
Term that is linear in the temperature. That is, that intercept there.

551
01:14:33,946 --> 01:14:37,816
And that a cubic term. That corresponds to the slope versus t squared.

552
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:45,016
The slope comes from the phonon gas that you.

553
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:58,636
Um, are already. Able to to work on based on photons, but for very low energies, that linear term in.

554
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:12,076
The heat capacity comes from the next correction, especially essentially to this summer expansion that.

555
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:18,116
We will be setting aside for now. So.

556
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:20,446
You don't need to do the full expansion,

557
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:28,786
but just enough of it to extract the functional form and confirm that it is a linear dependence once you get down to that heat capacity.

558
01:15:29,386 --> 01:15:33,226
So what has to happen is actually integrating.

559
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:43,886
That full integral. No longer approximating the Fermi function as a step function.

560
01:15:46,086 --> 01:15:58,596
So the way to do this? Well, one way in the way that I think is easiest to to manage with the tools that you have so far is integrating this by parts,

561
01:15:59,586 --> 01:16:02,916
arguing that the boundary term vanishes.

562
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:14,096
While the other. Remaining integral is sharply peaked around.

563
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:24,296
The threshold value that we have identified in our earlier work.

564
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:35,256
Which is to say. Right around.

565
01:16:36,706 --> 01:16:40,096
And energy approximately equal to the chemical potential.

566
01:16:41,886 --> 01:16:47,435
So with a sharply peaked integrand, what we can do to tackle that.

567
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:56,796
The formal Somerville expansion really just amounts to a Taylor expansion of the integrand around its maximum value.

568
01:16:59,936 --> 01:17:03,926
That expansion then gives more manageable integrals that.

569
01:17:05,476 --> 01:17:11,476
Without too much more manipulation, we'll produce the target result.

570
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:20,046
Linear dependence of the heat capacity at these very low temperatures where any of these causal factors,

571
01:17:20,656 --> 01:17:26,146
you know, square root to M cubed over pi squared h bar cubed, those can all be neglected or really rare.

572
01:17:26,806 --> 01:17:36,396
For the purposes of that tutorial, only interested in the functional form and confirming that the experimental measurements um,

573
01:17:36,746 --> 01:17:48,166
we are trying to reproduce can be described both by the phonons in the lattice structure as well as by the low temperature electron gas,

574
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:57,046
um, that becomes dominant for all of these materials when the temperature becomes very low.

575
01:18:03,706 --> 01:18:14,956
So a brief aside. Um, are there questions about the the nonzero energy in the low temperature limit or this picture of,

576
01:18:15,676 --> 01:18:20,356
um, the Fermi surface separating field and empty energy levels?

577
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:31,086
I'll actually do one more thing with that picture, which is to to justify the approximation or the assumption that we made earlier.

578
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:37,946
So when looking at the Fermi function, we.

579
01:18:39,336 --> 01:18:47,136
Assumed that the chemical potential was positive so that the energy could be either less than or greater than it.

580
01:18:48,126 --> 01:18:51,186
Um. And you want to.

581
01:18:53,636 --> 01:19:00,026
See that this is the. This is the case for a low temperature fermion gas.

582
01:19:00,506 --> 01:19:12,116
In contrast to the classical limit, where the chemical potential is a large negative number, or the photon gas where the chemical potential vanishes.

583
01:19:12,116 --> 01:19:18,445
Exactly. So we can do this justification based on our physical picture of a Fermi surface.

584
01:19:18,446 --> 01:19:26,876
By remembering the expression for chemical potential that we got from our generalised thermodynamic identity.

585
01:19:27,566 --> 01:19:31,076
How much does the energy change when we change the number of particles?

586
01:19:31,436 --> 01:19:37,766
Imposing a condition of constant entropy as well as keeping the the volume fixed.

587
01:19:39,116 --> 01:19:43,916
So in this simple zero temperature limit.

588
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:51,086
What we have really talking about the entropy is.

589
01:19:53,926 --> 01:20:04,366
We can express the entropy as in the usual way. Sum over all of the probabilities for the system to adopt each microstate I.

590
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:10,006
So pi times log pi. As t goes to zero.

591
01:20:10,636 --> 01:20:14,296
We really only have one microstate.

592
01:20:19,176 --> 01:20:21,546
With the corresponding probability of one.

593
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:30,276
To be adopted, and this is the microstate that corresponds to every energy level filled up to that Fermi surface.

594
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:35,496
Um, where the energy is equal to mu, the Fermi energy.

595
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:40,446
So the logarithm of one times one is zero.

596
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:46,146
So the energy is zero and it remains a zero.

597
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:50,305
Even if we add another particle. So add another particle.

598
01:20:50,306 --> 01:20:54,226
Refill the next available energy level. There's still only one microstate.

599
01:20:54,236 --> 01:20:58,046
There's still zero entropy. And.

600
01:21:00,366 --> 01:21:06,306
The entropy then remains constant. Even as we keep adding.

601
01:21:08,316 --> 01:21:11,856
Or, for that matter, removing particles from the system.

602
01:21:12,486 --> 01:21:22,716
The the microstate that is possible will change, but there is only ever one leading to constant zero entropy.

603
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:28,566
So that tells us that we can just consider without worrying about the entropy.

604
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:32,946
What happens to the energy when, say, we had some number of particles?

605
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:40,826
So that's a positive change in the number of particles.

606
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:45,656
And all that happens if we add particles.

607
01:21:46,256 --> 01:21:49,796
Is that the next energy level that is.

608
01:21:51,186 --> 01:21:58,376
Still empty will be filled. Formerly the.

609
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:03,236
Fermi energy will shift.

610
01:22:06,806 --> 01:22:09,326
But, uh, before it shifts,

611
01:22:09,326 --> 01:22:20,846
the the first open energy level will absorb whatever particle we add in the change in energy resulting from filling that level.

612
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:31,085
Well, it will be. The number of particles that we add multiplied by the energy of the level that we add them.

613
01:22:31,086 --> 01:22:37,356
Two which is going to be approximately that Fermi energy will make that an approximately equal to sign.

614
01:22:38,076 --> 01:22:43,116
All we really care about is whether this change the energy is positive or negative.

615
01:22:43,446 --> 01:22:49,896
It is very obviously positive and therefore our derivative.

616
01:22:50,526 --> 01:22:53,946
If we have an increase in particle number, we have an increase in energy.

617
01:22:54,276 --> 01:23:10,116
We have a positive chemical potential. And yeah, one of the interesting things we can do looking at the the Somerfield expansion more carefully if.

618
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:16,286
Time permits. You know, in the last week or two of the term.

619
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:29,096
That's, uh. Will allow us to cool to connect this zero temperature result of positive chemical potential.

620
01:23:31,126 --> 01:23:34,036
To higher temperatures and even confirm.

621
01:23:35,016 --> 01:23:45,066
That we end up with the chemical potential going below zero, changing sign as the temperature increases, and approaching in that way.

622
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:50,906
The. The classical limit at high temperatures.

623
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:58,036
With large negative chemical potentials that we've talked about previously.

624
01:24:00,856 --> 01:24:07,666
So any questions about energy particle number, chemical potential for fermion gases.

625
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:17,896
The one remaining piece for the fermion gas compared to the photon gas.

626
01:24:19,316 --> 01:24:27,686
We started off with today. We can make good progress and the last 15 minutes is going to be again the pressure.

627
01:24:28,916 --> 01:24:38,126
And here it's more obvious that we can expect pressure from non-relativistic gases of massive particles like electrons.

628
01:24:39,086 --> 01:24:46,166
So it's maybe less of a slippery concept in the radiation pressure, but it's the same definition.

629
01:24:47,406 --> 01:24:58,546
The response. Of the internal energy expectation value with response or with respect to the volume fixing the entropy.

630
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:10,415
So. A convenient form of the energy to plug in to start off with is just its relation to the

631
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:19,356
average particle number 3/5 times the chemical potential times the number of particles.

632
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:29,786
And another change compared to photons is that the condition of constant entropy is

633
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:37,706
going to be qualitatively different from both classical gases as well as photon gases.

634
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:48,206
In fact, we just went through the argument that for sufficiently low temperatures, the entropy is always zero and always constant at zero.

635
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:58,736
So at least in that limit. We will have a constant entropy.

636
01:26:00,896 --> 01:26:08,256
Pretty much by. Default just from having that single microstates.

637
01:26:12,956 --> 01:26:18,716
The nice physical picture of all energy levels being filled up to the Fermi energy.

638
01:26:18,776 --> 01:26:28,326
The Fermi surface. So the condition of constant entropy is pretty much automatically satisfied by working in the zero temperature limit.

639
01:26:28,956 --> 01:26:34,396
So we can. Insert into the derivative.

640
01:26:36,246 --> 01:26:40,596
The zero temperature value for the chemical potential.

641
01:26:40,596 --> 01:26:45,986
That's the Fermi energy. That was h bar squared over to M.

642
01:26:47,486 --> 01:26:50,546
Times at £0.03 squared and.

643
01:26:52,366 --> 01:27:05,866
Over V to the two thirds power. And well, when doing so we have a volume to the minus two thirds.

644
01:27:05,866 --> 01:27:10,296
That is the only. Part of this expression that depends on the volume.

645
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:16,026
Everything else, that negative sign can be pulled out front.

646
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:34,796
Three pi square to the. Two thirds power the number of particles now with one power here and two thirds power from the Fermi energy.

647
01:27:34,826 --> 01:27:44,666
So 5/3 power total, and then a very simple derivative V to the minus two thirds,

648
01:27:45,746 --> 01:27:51,596
which will give us a minus two thirds to cancel out that negative sign out front.

649
01:27:54,046 --> 01:27:57,946
As for the photon gas, a one over V comes along.

650
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:08,436
And also as for the photon gas. Everything else in here just collapses back down to the energy.

651
01:28:08,476 --> 01:28:15,836
The internal energy that we started off with. So.

652
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:21,936
We have here. Well, a.

653
01:28:24,356 --> 01:28:31,866
Something that we can consider. The fermion gas equation of states a relation between these large scale properties like pressure, volume, and energy.

654
01:28:32,736 --> 01:28:38,466
There are actually three ways that we can express these relations.

655
01:28:39,786 --> 01:28:44,145
So. Three expressions,

656
01:28:44,146 --> 01:28:49,126
each of which might be more useful depending on the circumstances and depending

657
01:28:49,126 --> 01:28:55,216
on what quantities we have or what quantities we are interested in predicting.

658
01:28:56,146 --> 01:28:59,506
So the pressure of the fermion gas.

659
01:29:02,116 --> 01:29:11,176
Well, we have. Just the simple expression up there it is two thirds times the energy density.

660
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:26,576
If we again plug in a simple zero temperature relation between energy and particle number, the two thirds times five halves will convert to 2/5,

661
01:29:27,716 --> 01:29:36,056
with an overall factor of that chemical potential and the particle number density and over v.

662
01:29:37,496 --> 01:29:49,076
And finally, if we, um, insert the Fermi energy that we had before in place of that chemical potential, then.

663
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:56,896
We cancel off the factor of two and get h bar squared over.

664
01:29:58,366 --> 01:30:07,006
5 a.m. we have a three pi squared to the two thirds power, and then we have.

665
01:30:08,226 --> 01:30:19,596
One plus two thirds is 5/3 factors of this particle number density and over V, which I will in fact just introduce a new quantity rho.

666
01:30:22,776 --> 01:30:33,546
That gets raised to the 5/3 where this row is just the density of the gas, the number of particles per unit volume.

667
01:30:36,336 --> 01:30:40,326
So essentially just a simple shorthand and.

668
01:30:43,266 --> 01:30:53,556
Um, in contrast to the photon gas that we worked with earlier today, or to the classical ideal gas law, where the.

669
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:58,166
The number of so and over v this.

670
01:30:59,716 --> 01:31:11,726
Number of particles in the ideal gas law is. Um, just related to the pressure and the temperature here as the temperature goes to zero.

671
01:31:12,506 --> 01:31:18,996
We. Still have a non-zero pressure and a non-zero density.

672
01:31:19,656 --> 01:31:25,106
Um. So non-zero. As T goes to zero.

673
01:31:25,116 --> 01:31:30,626
Unlike. The. Like classical behaviour.

674
01:31:33,016 --> 01:31:36,196
In the zero temperature limit. This nonzero pressure.

675
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:43,536
Um. Goes by the name of the degeneracy pressure.

676
01:31:47,956 --> 01:31:59,766
And it arises exactly from the Pauli exclusion principle that prevents all of these fermions from falling down into the lowest energy ground states.

677
01:31:59,776 --> 01:32:10,546
They have to keep filling energy levels up to the Fermi energy of the Fermi surface, which results in this degeneracy pressure.

678
01:32:11,536 --> 01:32:21,376
And that is one difference between this sort of intrinsically quantum effects compared to pressure as a force per unit area that we first introduced.

679
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:26,445
This pressure is not actually coming from any force that the particles are exerting on each other.

680
01:32:26,446 --> 01:32:32,806
They are not interacting with each other. It's a purely quantum mechanical effect.

681
01:32:33,226 --> 01:32:43,366
And I should also say this terminology of degeneracy is a different use of the word degenerate that has several meanings.

682
01:32:44,176 --> 01:32:49,636
Previously, we've used this to refer to multiple energy levels with the same value of the energy.

683
01:32:50,326 --> 01:32:52,756
Um, this use of the terminology.

684
01:32:56,386 --> 01:33:06,736
Is slightly different and refers to situations where all of the particles would want to have the same ground state energy.

685
01:33:08,086 --> 01:33:13,006
But are unable to to do so. So all of the energy levels are being filled.

686
01:33:14,446 --> 01:33:23,386
That is called a degenerate gas. In that zero temperature limit and the pressure of a degenerate gas is its degeneracy pressure.

687
01:33:26,546 --> 01:33:35,966
So, as I was saying, and what might be a good place to wrap up for today is.

688
01:33:37,496 --> 01:33:48,776
Connecting this low temperature nonzero degeneracy pressure to what we would expect in the high temperature classical limit, where.

689
01:33:50,436 --> 01:33:55,976
We have the ideal gas law. At play.

690
01:33:57,746 --> 01:34:06,986
So remember the ideal gas law PV equals n t or rearranging the pressure is n over v times t,

691
01:34:07,376 --> 01:34:12,776
which is what we have defined as our particle number density.

692
01:34:15,536 --> 01:34:25,616
So that means that there is going to be a change, going from the low energies of the fermion gas to the high energies of classical gases.

693
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:31,256
At low energies, there is expressions that are all independent of the temperature.

694
01:34:31,826 --> 01:34:34,976
At high energies we expect linear behaviour.

695
01:34:35,426 --> 01:34:45,056
And if we compute again that summer field expansion to get us to higher temperatures, this is the functional form that would predict.

696
01:34:45,836 --> 01:34:53,496
For now we can just look at the two limits. So as the temperature becomes large.

697
01:34:54,696 --> 01:35:05,136
We go into the classical regime, where the pressure on the vertical axis is just the density times the temperature.

698
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:10,656
So we should have a straight line which we can see forming up here.

699
01:35:11,196 --> 01:35:20,406
Where. The slope of that line on this plot is just the density of the classical ideal gas.

700
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:27,636
If we go the other direction down to low and eventually zero temperatures.

701
01:35:28,876 --> 01:35:32,886
We get. To the degenerate Fermi gas.

702
01:35:37,056 --> 01:35:42,186
And the degeneracy pressure here is independent of the temperature.

703
01:35:42,756 --> 01:35:47,076
And just related to that density to the 5/3 power.

704
01:35:47,526 --> 01:35:53,806
And there is a interesting. Crossover between those two types of behaviour that.

705
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:59,746
We will set aside for now, but may come back to.

706
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:03,866
If time permits later on in the term.

707
01:36:11,576 --> 01:36:23,126
What we will pick up with on Tuesday is just a very quick application of this equation of state for low temperature fairy gases.

708
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:33,356
Looking at where this degeneracy pressure matters and plays a role, and where we can pick out actual observable physics, that is, um.

709
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:38,986
Not easily describable by classical mechanics, so we will be focusing on.

710
01:36:42,206 --> 01:36:46,256
The regime where these intrinsically quantum effects.

711
01:36:48,696 --> 01:36:53,586
Matter and in fact dominate. And this will be on the temperature is low,

712
01:36:54,216 --> 01:37:01,806
and especially when it is low compared to the Fermi energy that is formally defined in that zero temperature limit.

713
01:37:02,436 --> 01:37:10,796
And. We will see is proportional to rho to the two thirds power just coming from.

714
01:37:13,136 --> 01:37:18,495
Um. The expression that we derived earlier today.

715
01:37:18,496 --> 01:37:24,286
So there is that row to the two thirds power hiding in our result for that Fermi energy.

716
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:32,936
Um. So this is the the relevant scale rather than requiring.

717
01:37:35,636 --> 01:37:39,626
Reaching the absolute or the exact limit of absolute zero temperature.

718
01:37:40,286 --> 01:37:44,246
We can have nonzero temperatures as long as they are low compared to the Fermi energy.

719
01:37:44,606 --> 01:37:55,916
So we will look at some physical examples where this inequality is satisfied, and the physical effects of the degeneracy pressure can be identified.

720
01:37:56,936 --> 01:38:01,166
So I'll leave you with that forecast for next week too to wrap up today.

721
01:38:01,736 --> 01:38:10,976
But happy to take any questions if you have them. Otherwise, uh, shut things down.

722
01:38:10,996 --> 01:38:16,756
Moved to office hours and wish you luck with the homework if you have not, uh, submitted it already.
