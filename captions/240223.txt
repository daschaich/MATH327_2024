1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,320
That should be the recording underway. So we'll get it.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,610
Get going. The clock on the wall is a few minutes fast,

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:21,850
but it is time for us to kick off today and I'll start by putting down the attendance code on the projected notes as well.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,050
Bit of a smaller crowd today, I suspect, because some folks might need to recover from that computer project.

5
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,189
Good news is that if the computer project was not to your liking,

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:43,149
it's done now and the rest of the module in its assessment will be more traditional homeworks and exams.

7
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:50,020
And we go back next week to the kind of more traditional schedule of lecture on Tuesday

8
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,340
morning for one hour tutorial Thursday afternoon over in the engineering building.

9
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,930
And then this Friday, two hour block is what stays constant.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,940
That will also help us get through in a more material light, a bit more of a pace.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,410
Think in the mini questionnaire that ran through last weekend.

12
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,880
Nobody had major objections to the pace either being too fast or slow.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:29,060
Some didn't know difficulty that I suspect was related to that computer project and I should apologise when I since this week's

14
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,730
announcement canvas was misbehaving and not actually showing me any free four written comments that came in with that mini questionnaire,

15
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,600
making it look like nobody had said anything for any of those stop, start continue prompts.

16
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,380
It turned out people had I just had to dig through the guts of canvas in order to find that there were

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:59,950
a couple of people asking for the gaps in the lecture notes to be filled and uploaded to canvas.

18
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,800
So if you have been looking at the lecture notes, you'll recall that there are, well,

19
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,810
things like these gaps places for you to fill in and check your understanding.

20
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:25,340
We cover most, not necessarily all of those in the lecture and in the project, two notes that are scanned PDFs of what goes up on the document camera.

21
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Whenever a gap is filled, it gets blocked off in green like so with the page number noted.

22
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:46,700
So. That is something that is there for you already in terms of moving on from the computer project onto the next bit of assessment.

23
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,250
That's a first homework assignment due in about ten days from now, the 5th of March.

24
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,050
You will get it within the next few days, so you'll have at least a week to work on that.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,910
And in the meantime, I'll be marking those computer projects.

26
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,410
I learned something this week that apparently I'm not supposed to return feedback until at least

27
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,870
two weeks have passed from the deadlines in case people later on have extenuating circumstances,

28
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,820
requests or removal of late penalties. So I think I initially promised feedback before then.

29
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:29,510
It'll be delayed, hopefully not by too much. So lots of logistics there.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,010
Any questions about that before we turn to physics?

31
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,230
And it's been a week since we last had a lecture.

32
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:55,190
So let's recap that. Last Friday we introduced the Micro Canonical Ensemble as the first statistical ensemble that we

33
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:04,730
look at a realisation of probability spaces specialised to collections of degrees of freedom whose.

34
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,480
Micro states are sampled just by letting the system sit and seeing how it evolves over time,

35
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:22,060
moving from one state to the next subject to certain physical constraints and in the case of the micro canonical ensemble.

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,850
The constraints are that the energy, specifically the internal energy of the particles,

37
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,960
has to be conserved as time passes, as does the total number of degrees of freedom or particles.

38
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:45,389
So a useful cartoon to give you a kind of mental shortcut for this for a micro

39
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,120
canonical ensemble is that we have some collection of degrees of freedom.

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,910
And in order to keep the number of particles at the energy constant,

41
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,300
we require that these particles are effectively completely isolated from the rest of the universe.

42
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,110
Here they're sitting in a beaker and there's a note. There's some insulation around there that puts in a hard barrier,

43
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:19,710
making it impossible for particles to go in or out, as well as for any energy to go in or out, which.

44
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,240
Is this something to consider pointed out makes it difficult to actually observe a micro canonical ensemble

45
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:39,020
since any observation we can conceivably do implement involves in some way exchanging energy with a system.

46
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,239
So today we will think about how we can get a more useful description of

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,860
statistical systems that while still obeying that first law of thermodynamics,

48
00:05:49,520 --> 00:06:00,980
energy conservation allows us to actually look at a system, measure it, observe it, and do physics with it.

49
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:14,400
Before we get to that, though, that's still to come. And starting from the micro Canonical ensemble,

50
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,679
we introduced some derived quantities that in stable thermodynamic equilibrium are going to be

51
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,400
smooth and stable over time and depend on these conserved quantities that characterise the ensemble.

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,990
So the first one we looked at is the famous entropy and the related second law of thermodynamics.

53
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,530
And there is a general definition of entropy that holds for any statistical ensemble,

54
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:50,590
not just the micro canonical case that is the negative sum over all of those microstates

55
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,090
all of the possible states that the particles in the system can be arranged.

56
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,560
Of that probability multiplied by its log and all summed up.

57
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:12,010
And the second law says that in general, as time passes, the entropy can never decrease.

58
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,970
And generically, except in very special situations, it always increases rather than staying the same.

59
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,070
The second law then has a consequence that if we maximise the entropy.

60
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:37,480
We know that we have reached the smooth and stable state over time that corresponds to.

61
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,260
Thermodynamic equilibrium where everything is.

62
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:56,680
Simplified by depending only on the conserved quantities and being able to be expressed as functions of just those few conserved quantities.

63
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,530
And as a reminder, this thermodynamic equilibrium, while it is stable, it is not static.

64
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,050
It's still a dynamic system that is constantly probabilistically sampling the

65
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,490
different micro states that are available to it with these probabilities.

66
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:25,390
And in the micro canonical case, the probability for any accessible micro states with the conserved energy and particle number all have to be equal.

67
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,370
In that particular case of the micro canonical ensemble.

68
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:43,540
And those probabilities for the different micro states essentially specify the complete information about the system.

69
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,990
So shout out if there are questions related to what we've covered before.

70
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,880
While. While you consider that, we'll look ahead to the plan for today.

71
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,570
Is to introduce the temperature in the context of the micro canonical ensemble.

72
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,890
That's a familiar quantity from everyday life, but not one that is conserved in the micro canonical up.

73
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,219
So we have to define it as another derived quantity similar to the entropy that depends

74
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:26,620
on the conserved quantities inside and then see whether this formal mathematical

75
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:34,540
definition corresponds to our intuition or experience from everyday life in the

76
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:41,530
way we would normally talk about temperature in English as opposed to mathematics.

77
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,349
We'll look at a couple of examples for that.

78
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:53,830
First, looking at a spin system that will give us some new and maybe unexpected behaviour for the temperature,

79
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,070
and then consider heat exchange and flows of energy more generally,

80
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,960
which will behave a bit more as we expect, and connect the mathematics of statistical physics to our.

81
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,120
Intuition.

82
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:24,960
And after that, the next big topic is fairly quickly moving on from the micro canonical ensemble to the case that's called the canonical Ensemble.

83
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,330
We will see how this is defined later on, but.

84
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,620
Some of the key concepts to be introduced to Oops, I wrote that wrong are the partition function.

85
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,610
Essentially the collection of all information governing a system described by the canonical ensemble.

86
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,929
So something to look forward to. And then we'll look at some derived quantities in the canonical case to be

87
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,670
able to contrast that with the micro canonical case aiming in particular at.

88
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,450
A quantity known as the heat capacity. Something that.

89
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,950
We will revisit in a few different contexts later on, both now and later on in this module.

90
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:23,950
If we don't get to higher capacity today than we certainly will on Tuesday morning and in the homework after that.

91
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,240
So unless. There are objections.

92
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,690
Let's move on and put this plan into practice.

93
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,710
So starting with that temperature, the guy already.

94
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:56,970
Said out loud that this is. Another derived quantity in the microeconomic setting.

95
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,260
So. Like the entropy.

96
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,910
It is a function of the conserved quantities, energy and particle number, at least when we.

97
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:19,750
Declare that we are considering systems in some of the damage equilibrium, which is what we will do in this module.

98
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:30,680
And. Rather than trying to motivate this definition,

99
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:40,190
let's just write it down and then look at it in a few examples in a few contexts to see how it behaves.

100
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,370
So we'll actually define things in terms of the inverse temperature of one over T and say that this is.

101
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:57,190
Equal to the derivative of the entropy with respect to that conserved energy given a fixed number of particles.

102
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:07,630
And if we recall of the micro canonical ensemble in thermodynamic equilibrium, the entropy is just the logarithm of the number of micro states in.

103
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,650
We directly. Connect that temperature.

104
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,769
To simply counting the number of micro states,

105
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,880
all of which are appearing with equal probability in thermodynamic equilibrium for the microeconomic ensemble.

106
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:38,410
So a way to interpret the meaning of this equation is that if we add energy to a system.

107
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,460
So we know that the micro economical system has conserved energy,

108
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,519
but here we are considering what happens if we were to change from one micro canonical system with a certain

109
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,830
energy to another micro canonical system with the same number of particles and just a bit more energy.

110
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:07,490
What is the response of the entropy to that? If the entropy increases by a large amount.

111
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,940
And that corresponds to a large partial derivative and a large one over T.

112
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,820
Which in turn means a small temperature.

113
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:35,110
And vice versa. So the temperature here is being defined in terms of how sensitive the entropy

114
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,350
is to the amount of energy that we have in our isolated micro canonical system.

115
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:49,350
And similarly, if there is only a small increase in energy from adding a bit of sorry,

116
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,090
only a small increase in entropy from adding a bit of energy, we end up with a large temperature.

117
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:04,010
One over t is very small. And there are some ways this behaves as we would expect.

118
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:11,450
Some ways it may not. So let's look at an extended example of the letter.

119
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:21,620
What used to be a tutorial exercise, but we don't have a tutorial this week, so we'll go over it just directly in the lecture.

120
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:34,940
And this is using the spin system that we've introduced already to see how the temperature behaves for the microeconomic spin system.

121
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:43,690
As a reminder, the energy for a spin system is related to the external magnetic field with positive strength.

122
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,810
H. And then.

123
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,520
There is a contribution of negative H from the end plus spins that align with

124
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,460
that external field and a contribution of plus H from the end minus spins

125
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:07,710
that are anti align which we can reorganise to depend just on the total number of spins and as well as twice the number of upward pointing spins.

126
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:20,350
So if we have. Some different value of the energy in this open system conserved in the micro canonical case.

127
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:33,480
That basically boils down to having different numbers of upward pointing spins out of the total number and capital in that is fixed,

128
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,709
which then affects the number of micro states that we have with that particular number of upward pointing spins from

129
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:50,250
the log of the micro states that affects the entropy and from that we get the temperature and its dependence on E,

130
00:16:50,610 --> 00:17:00,180
So we have a string of quantities to compute in order to see how the temperature of the spin system behaves.

131
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,999
As an illustration to maybe make this more concrete.

132
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,650
What I mean by having different and plus number of micro stages, entropy and temperature, we can start by thinking about a few special cases.

133
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:28,020
And hopefully you will agree that the lowest energy for this system corresponds to every

134
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:35,040
single spin being aligned with that external magnetic field and each of them contributing.

135
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,780
One unit of minus H and energy.

136
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:54,540
So in this particular micro state, with all of the spins aligned, that end plus just equals n, they are all aligned and minus equals zero.

137
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:04,450
The energy that I'll call E0 is just a minus H times all and upward pointing spins.

138
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:12,220
And the number of microstates that we have with this energy is just the the one that I drew here.

139
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:20,140
There is a single. Micro states are completely determined by having every single spin pointing up.

140
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:31,590
So that is the simplest possible case and the next simplest to consider is the next lowest energy.

141
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,370
Sometimes called the first excited energy level.

142
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,959
That's terminology that we don't need to worry about for the time being.

143
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,930
But I mentioned it as a forecast of things coming up around the time of the spring break.

144
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,040
And hopefully here as well you will be.

145
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:09,530
Content for me to say that the next lowest energy comes from having the next largest number of spins aligned with the field.

146
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,860
Every spin except for one has to be aligned with it.

147
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,059
So might have one toward the end that is anti aligned.

148
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:28,850
But of course that one single spin pointing down against the field could be any one of the end.

149
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,730
So long as it is only one. What that means is that and pluses now and minus one you have one anti aligned spin.

150
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,750
The energy when we have one spin anti aligned to the magnetic field picks up a

151
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:55,890
minus H from the n minus one upward pointing spins plus that single h which is.

152
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,710
Now a minus and minus two times that magnetic field strength.

153
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,640
So I need to get that onto the screen there.

154
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,590
That's just keeping track of negative signs. And the more interesting next step is.

155
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:30,410
To follow the number of micro states with this next lowest energy.

156
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,350
So as I said, we have a choice of any one of these and spins could be the one aligned against the magnetic field.

157
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,560
So that gives us an options for in different micro states and different configurations of spins,

158
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,010
all of which have the same next to lowest energy and have to be counted when considering the

159
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,280
entropy and temperature of the system with the energy fixed and the micro canonical approach.

160
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:10,160
And we want to generalise this to any energy corresponding to any number of upward and downward pointing spins out of our whole system.

161
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:20,800
The trick to do so is to recognise that this end, as well as this zero, corresponds to binomial coefficients.

162
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,830
And she one and up here and she zero.

163
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:44,240
And in general. We can basically write down the number of microstates for a given number of anti aligned spins.

164
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:51,440
Just being the total number of spins from which we choose and minus to be anti aligned.

165
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:03,440
And if we recall the general definition of the binomial coefficient, the full set factorial in the numerator multiplied by.

166
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:14,750
The smaller set that we choose in the denominator and then the difference between them and minus sorry, n minus and sub minus,

167
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:24,920
which is known to its friends as and plus all of the other spins that we don't use to be aligned against the magnetic field are aligned with it.

168
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:35,690
There is actually a symmetry here between an plus and minus, and we could use those two binomial coefficients interchangeably.

169
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:45,799
We get the same fraction in both cases just because n minus plus n plus add up to the total number of spins.

170
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,080
N. So hopefully, so far so good.

171
00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:08,010
And the next step on our path to the temperature is getting the entropy from the counting these micro states for any given conserved energy.

172
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:17,000
And just looking ahead in order to get the temperature, you will actually not only need that entropy.

173
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:30,219
But it's derivative with respect to energy. And in order to take a derivative with respect to energy,

174
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:37,990
we need to get the functional form of this number of micro states into the conserved quantities he had m.

175
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,970
That we expect should characterise it in somewhat an epic equilibrium.

176
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,870
So we need. And plus and minus.

177
00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:03,250
In terms of our large scale. Macroscopic conserved quantities that characterise this micro canonical system.

178
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:11,350
And even more than just getting an plus and minus written in terms of those quantities, we need to make sure that the.

179
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:18,160
Function that we have is differentiable so that we can take this derivative to get the temperature.

180
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:40,950
And I'll say in advance that the differentiable function we will go after here is going to be an approximation to the.

181
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,170
Derivative of the logarithm of these binomial coefficients.

182
00:24:52,970 --> 00:25:05,540
We want to. Get some way of approximating factorial functions by differentiable functions.

183
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:15,560
Continuous and differentiable functions. One way to do that is known as Sterling's approximation, which we will look at in next week's tutorial.

184
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:25,580
I'll do something different here just to give you some maximum variety and note that the spin system that we are considering.

185
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,860
Is actually a random walk. In the space of its energies.

186
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:44,600
And to clarify. What I mean by that and what I mean by energy space.

187
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:52,670
We can see that if we look from one spin to the next in this line, what it amounts to is.

188
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:01,730
A single step in the energy. The length of that step.

189
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:10,550
The amount that the energy varies is either plus or minus H, depending on whether the spin is up or down,

190
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,010
equivalent to a step to a positive or negative direction of.

191
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:27,950
Energy. And we can rewrite this as a step of plus or minus one in a variable x, which is.

192
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,200
For simplicity. E divided by the total energy, divided by units of minus H.

193
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:43,910
So basically choosing a appropriate system of units and normalisation.

194
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,160
Which.

195
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:58,520
We remember how e and H are related to the number of spins E over minus H just gives us twice the number of upward pointing spins minus the total.

196
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,660
Will that fit on here? It is higher up in the page anyway.

197
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:17,490
So we are walking in the number of upward pointing spins, just as in the same way as in our simple example.

198
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,260
In earlier lectures we walked in left or right for two oriented steps.

199
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,600
So this is in fact the simplest case of a one dimensional random walk.

200
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:46,510
And in particular because there is an equal probability a priori for either spin to point either up or down.

201
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:59,140
Each of those two options. The P's and Q's for probabilities of steps of plus or minus one that we had are both equally weighted.

202
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,370
50% chance that has been pointing up or it's been pointing down.

203
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:16,990
So that is not only the simple example we considered, but the simplest realisation of that example.

204
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:25,690
Rather than having arbitrary PS and Qs for this fixed unit length step, we have equal probabilities so that all.

205
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,120
To to the power in of these walks.

206
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,130
Where each walk corresponds to a configuration.

207
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:51,969
Of the and spins. Are equally likely, the probability for each particular one is just one over two to the in the choice of words or downwards,

208
00:28:51,970 --> 00:29:00,460
pointing spin at each step and the total number of microstates for a given energy.

209
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,170
That we can write when looking at the system in this way is.

210
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:18,590
The total number of walks times the probability of having and plus spins corresponding

211
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:25,400
to the energy of interest in this subscript here should actually be in minus.

212
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,410
Which can be interchanged with and plus thinks that symmetry in the binomial coefficient we saw earlier,

213
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,920
this is essentially just rewriting what we had earlier the probability of having.

214
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:48,190
Spit a walk with and spit is pointing up is the total number of such walks that we have.

215
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,090
The order doesn't matter. So it's the binomial coefficient and choose and plus.

216
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,990
And then we normalise by the total number of spins.

217
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,750
That's essentially restating what we found earlier when generalising to simple cases

218
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:13,420
to now be written in the language of random walks that we have some experience with.

219
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:30,510
So what we want to do is to proceed to our ultimate goal of a differentiable function for this number of microstates is.

220
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,180
To determine a differentiable function for this probability.

221
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,230
Which we have seen you can do from the central limit theorem.

222
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:49,620
So we will get an approximate probability. From the central limit theorem.

223
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:56,790
Assuming that an is much larger than one we recall,

224
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:12,330
we have a probability distribution for this variable x that we just defined to be the energy in units of minus H related to the number of steps,

225
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:21,300
the number of upward pointing spins. And for large and this is approximately equal to.

226
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,260
Usual to pi and various factor and then a Gaussian exponential.

227
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,450
With a minus. X minus.

228
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:39,000
And you? Squared. And the variance showing up in the denominator again.

229
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:51,090
And we recall this is useful because the mean value and the variance sigma squared are defined for the single step process.

230
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,160
So that's all we have to consider to bring the central limit theorem to bear.

231
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:08,430
The mean we derived in detail in a previous lecture, it was $0.02 minus one for a single step.

232
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,030
And plugging in equals a half. We get zero trivially.

233
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,520
This should make sense and equal probability of a spin pointing up or spin pointing down.

234
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:31,370
Add them together a average to zero. And in the mean is just that expectation value summing over all possible outcomes of this single step.

235
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:43,010
Similarly we derived that the variance was for P, Q, P and Q are both a half that cancel out the for to give one.

236
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,320
So we can plug that into the central limit theorem.

237
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:59,170
Sigma squared is one music mu is zero, so only the x squared remains.

238
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:08,980
And that is a differentiable function in terms of x and N for the probability distribution

239
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,520
corresponding to this particular set of spin configurations where they give an energy.

240
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:24,980
Of course, a lowercase p for the distribution is not the same as this upper case probability.

241
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,090
And in that very first week's tutorial,

242
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:38,540
we explored various approximations that we could make to integrate the distribution and get a probability out of it.

243
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:46,220
That is a key step. We have a distribution.

244
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,540
We have to integrate it over some range in order to find the probability corresponding to that range.

245
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:00,440
And the simplest thing we can do is. Use the constant approximation.

246
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:11,790
We checked. In the tutorial for large and gives a good description of the exact results.

247
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,240
So remember that this is the statement that.

248
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:32,090
P and plus, we assume that the probability distribution is constant around the centre of a small interval centred at the x corresponding to and plus.

249
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:43,320
So x was two and plus minus N, and then because that is constant and we integrate, we just get that constant times the size of the interval,

250
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:53,850
the delta and plus, which is just counting the number of spins that we have as we add a single spin.

251
00:34:54,450 --> 00:35:01,380
So every time we add one spin we get a delta n of one and that multiplication drops out.

252
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,380
So the integral. Just becomes.

253
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:14,100
The expression, the caution factor from the central limit theorem.

254
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:25,139
Now, with our ex plugged in equal to the energy divided by H and I'll drop some of the subscripts s of and minus four.

255
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:35,590
Now where I. We can keep in mind that that is the particular energy that we are interested in.

256
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:42,970
It gets squared from x we have to and and H squared also coming from x.

257
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:54,640
So this is our answer. That the number of microstates for a given energy for this system is this

258
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,590
probability multiplied by the total number of spin configurations that we have.

259
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,510
And it is an approximation. Accurate in the margin limit.

260
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,340
It just brings a factor of two to the end. Multiplying.

261
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,490
Everything else that comes along for the ride.

262
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:27,820
And we can just determine the inverse temperature from the derivative of the logarithm of this number of microstates directly.

263
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,700
We keep n fixed. So that's a constant and.

264
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:42,320
What happens when we apply the law to these to this number of micro states?

265
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,080
The log of the product of these two factors breaks up into the sum of the logs.

266
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:54,350
The log of the exponential is just its arguments. E squared over two an H squared,

267
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:04,190
and then the log of everything else is independent of the energy and we'll just cancel out when we take the derivative of it.

268
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,140
So we don't need to worry about it.

269
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:15,680
And I'm sure you've already done in your head the derivative of e squared with respect to E is just to E to choose cancel,

270
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,510
and we have an H squared in the denominator.

271
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:29,840
So inverting the temperature. For the spin system is.

272
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,560
Approximately again in the large and limited. Negative and H squared divided by E.

273
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,020
And I should specify, this has been much greater than what it also has.

274
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:56,790
Nonzero magnetic field, which I should have pointed out when we defined this X, we defined that as the energy in units of the magnetic field.

275
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,540
So implicitly assuming that we're not dividing by zero here.

276
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,730
So H is strictly positive in this calculation using the central limit theorem.

277
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,280
So that is the result. What does it mean?

278
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:24,960
You might already be seeing a few unexpected aspects of this temperature.

279
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,470
So some features that are unusual compared to.

280
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:39,670
Our daily experience with gases and things other than these spinning systems.

281
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,610
For one thing, if this energy approach is zero,

282
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:54,760
which corresponds to equal numbers of upward and downward pointing spins with a non-zero magnetic field, the temperature goes to infinity.

283
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,520
It is divergence. That limits.

284
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:11,340
That's and plus approximately equal to and minus and even more generally if the energy is

285
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:19,680
positive so that there are more spins anti aligned against the magnetic field compared it to.

286
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,700
Those aligned with it, then the overall negative sign.

287
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:33,320
That gives us a negative temperature, something we are not used to in everyday life.

288
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,050
So that happens whenever there are more.

289
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:50,180
Downward pointing spins and minus anti align with magnetic field compared to the number of aligned fields.

290
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,889
And this is something that should be causing you concern.

291
00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:02,870
You probably are familiar with the statement that temperatures can never go below absolute zero.

292
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:11,959
They can never become negative. This is a feature of the micro canonical ensemble that does not match the

293
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,130
physical systems that we can actually observe by exchanging energy with them.

294
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:26,000
It has a very precise mathematical meaning from our definition of temperature, so a negative temperature in the micro canonical case just means that.

295
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,510
The number of microstates available decreases whenever energy is added to the system.

296
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:50,270
That filters through to a decrease in entropy and then a decrease in the derivative.

297
00:40:50,780 --> 00:41:01,100
Well, sorry, a decrease in entropy gives you a negative derivative, which was a case that we could have considered already back from the definition,

298
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:08,390
we only talk about adding energy and assuming that the entropy increased either by a large amount or by a small amount.

299
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:15,230
We didn't consider what would happen if the entropy decreased when energy was added.

300
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:15,770
Well,

301
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:25,550
that's exactly what happens for the spin system and gives the negative value negative temperature from that definition in terms of the derivative,

302
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,250
that is something unnatural.

303
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,980
And in fact, there is a. Definition related to this.

304
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:49,940
So this will sound like an English language statement, but it arises as a formal mathematical definition.

305
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:57,760
We define a natural system. To have positive energy.

306
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:10,350
So the statement that whenever energy is added to a natural system, the number of microstates available for it to occupy necessarily increases.

307
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:17,700
And so in the case of the example, we just did so for the spin system.

308
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:30,510
That spin system is natural whenever the energy is less than zero, so it's negative sign cancels out the overall negative sign in our result,

309
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:36,899
which happens whenever there are more upward pointing spins aligned with the

310
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,930
field compared to the number of downward pointing spins anti aligned against it.

311
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:50,370
That is the natural regime for a spin system where if we start from.

312
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,850
This is, again, specific to the spend system, the minimum energy.

313
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,510
For the spin system. Go here or.

314
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:09,760
Sorry, the. The minimum natural temperature in the skin system.

315
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,640
Example. Is the case where the energy is most negative.

316
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,550
So that is that lowest energy micro states we looked at earlier.

317
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:37,240
So. We get the minimum and we have that E0, which I'll remind you is minus an H.

318
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,060
Every single and every single one of the end spins as a minus H to the energy.

319
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,740
And if we plug that in here, the negatives cancel the ends.

320
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,730
Cancel and one factor of the H cancels.

321
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,920
So Taemin is plus H for this lowest energy.

322
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,340
And then as we add energy.

323
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:17,540
It goes to a higher temperature. Eventually diverging when a number of.

324
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,020
Anti align spins, approaches half of the system starting from zero.

325
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:32,580
So increasing the number of spins aligned against the magnetic field moves the energy from negative values up to zero,

326
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,130
which is where the temperature diverges to a positive infinite amount.

327
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,530
And that is.

328
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:57,419
Through the culmination of a first example illustration of a micro canonical definition of temperature as another derived quantity similar to entropy,

329
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:06,420
depending only on the conserved quantities. And this may actually be a nice place to pause.

330
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,140
See if you have questions or objections to this calculation or any broader questions

331
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:21,840
about the meaning of this behaviour of temperature as defined in the canonical setting.

332
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,200
Because this example took a little longer than I thought it might.

333
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:46,310
This might be a good point to take a break and break up the two hour block of lectures and restarts by changing focus to a application

334
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:55,850
of temperature and the micro canonical ensemble that makes a bit more sense and then go into the canonical ensemble after that.

335
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:05,270
So we are. And a few minutes before 1150.

336
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:17,180
So maybe if we reconvene two or 3 minutes before noon, we will pick up with something, some application of temperature that is less counterintuitive.

337
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:22,950
Sound good? I see nods and.

338
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:42,280
That is the recording resumed. And the one last final bit of the micro canonical ensemble to take care of today is considering a more general.

339
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,980
Application or illustration of this definition of temperature.

340
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,110
To the case of heat exchange.

341
00:46:53,410 --> 00:47:03,490
Where as a spoiler in advance, I can say that this will give us a shock that the.

342
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:13,020
Formal definition of temperature. Gives physically sensible behaviour.

343
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:29,550
In a line with our intuition. And without any need to define particularly unnatural or natural cases.

344
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:40,940
In seeing that exchange of heat between two systems with different temperatures behaves as you would expect.

345
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:47,870
So the setup as that introduction applies implies, is going to go through three steps.

346
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:53,000
So we initially start with two isolated micro canonical subsystems.

347
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:01,340
And both of these are going to be separately in thermodynamic equilibrium.

348
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:13,050
So as a shorthand illustration, draw one system in its box, isolated from the rest of the universe over on the left.

349
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:20,550
Call it system Omega a with some number of particles and a some energy A,

350
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,750
and we'll specify for simplicity that it has a natural temperature resulting from

351
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:35,220
those conserved quantities and e they give a temperature to that is greater than zero.

352
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:45,300
Similarly, for a second subsystem omega be isolated from the rest of the universe off to the right.

353
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,680
With a similar natural temperature.

354
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:59,070
So we take these two subsystems independently thermal lines with different temperatures to A.B and we put them into thermal contact.

355
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,980
Which is something we looked at last week to derive a form of the second law of thermodynamics.

356
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,080
So in cartoon form are two systems.

357
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,270
Now are remain isolated from the rest of the universe.

358
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:27,970
They are only in thermal contacts of the number of particles in each subsystem stays fixed.

359
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:34,000
But the total amount of energy can now slosh back and forth between this.

360
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:42,200
Barrier between them. So there's no longer complete isolation from each other, just from the rest of the universe,

361
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:49,280
and it's only the total energy AEA plus EB that is conserved.

362
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,030
So we'll call this. System of legacy coming after A and B,

363
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:04,839
and we wait long enough for this new system or the combined system with thermal contact to reach some equilibrium

364
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:14,140
itself and say that it equilibrate to some temperature t c that is now common to both of those subsystems.

365
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:23,210
So, so far we've just done the same consideration as we did when introducing the second law of thermodynamics.

366
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:30,890
The new wrinkle, the new step that we add to consider heat exchange is now to re isolate.

367
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:37,290
Those two subsystems. So.

368
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,990
Re-insert to the isolation between the two of them.

369
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:49,420
Take them back off to. Complete isolation themselves.

370
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:59,680
We have now an updated omega prime A that may no longer be exactly the same as the initial micro canonical system,

371
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,180
because although its number of particles has been fixed throughout,

372
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:11,830
the energy may have been updated to some time, resulting in some new temperature to prime.

373
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:23,130
And similarly for system B. The energy is updated, the number of particles is not the temperature.

374
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:33,639
Has quite possibly changed through this process of coming into thermal equilibrium and then being re isolated into separate systems.

375
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:40,750
So what we would naively expect if we were to do this in our lab and every day or to do this by.

376
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,410
Putting a hot drink in a cold box and then taking it out.

377
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,930
The generic expectation is that energy. We'll flow.

378
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,600
From the hotter system into the colder system,

379
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:12,040
lowering the energy of the hotter system and raising the energy of the colder system to something somewhere in between.

380
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:29,620
And this is. What we want to check based on the mathematics we've developed for the micro canonical ensemble.

381
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:38,320
So to set up that check, we will express these final energies.

382
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:44,340
So east of S Prime, we're s is a label for the system, either A or B,

383
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:53,889
So we say that this is the initial energy, energy A or B plus whatever energy flow.

384
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:59,990
There was the change in energy from step one or state.

385
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:12,190
Yeah, step one to step three in this procedure and from the first law of thermodynamics that conserves the overall energy A plus B,

386
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:22,990
we know that any energy lost or gained from subsystem A must be equal and opposite to whatever happened to that other subsystem.

387
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:31,090
And just for simplicity, we'll do a tailor expansion of the new energy around its starting point.

388
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:43,110
So what this amounts to is looking at functions of this energy and in particular the entropy.

389
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,450
That gives us the temperature through a simple derivative. The.

390
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:56,690
Entropy is a function of the final temperature for each of those two subsystems equals A or B.

391
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,240
This depends on these conserved quantities.

392
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:13,719
So the initial energy plus whatever changed and the Taylor expansion says that we start from the initial entropy,

393
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,800
the initial value of this function and what we add to it.

394
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,169
Depends on. The response of the entropy.

395
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:33,329
So how? The entropy depends on the energy, and in each case evaluated at the initial entropy, the initial energy that we started off with.

396
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,840
So I should note that unlike,

397
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,719
unfortunately reusing notation here or the vertical bar in some cases means a

398
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,390
derivative taken with a quantity fixed like in the definition of temperature.

399
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:56,790
Here it means the derivative is evaluated for the energy equal to the initial use of s in each system.

400
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:03,959
Hopefully pillar expansions are something you've seen before, so this is reasonably familiar.

401
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,520
We look at the response and then multiply it by the amount of change that we have.

402
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:18,719
And this is a systematic expansion that can be continued to however many higher orders in this change in energy that we want.

403
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:26,220
So all of those higher orders start at the change in energy squared and go up to cubed callback and so on.

404
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:35,970
And again, for simplicity we can make the assumption that the change in energy is going to be small compared to the

405
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:43,110
scale of the energies themselves so that we can truncate this Taylor expansion after just that first term.

406
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:53,970
So this is an approximation that is valid when we have a lot of energy in the system so that the energy flow is modest,

407
00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:00,570
It can be done without loss of generality, but I'll skip that more detailed discussion in the interest of keeping things moving,

408
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:09,390
this truncation gives us an approximation that says the final entropy in each system is related to the initial entropy,

409
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:17,760
plus the change in energy in each system now multiplied by this derivative,

410
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:26,130
which we can recognise, as does T is one over t in the micro canonical ensemble,

411
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:33,420
the temperature for each system and evaluated at stage one in this process.

412
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:40,040
The ayes to and tbe that we assume to be natural from the start.

413
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,980
Is this an acceptable argument to to all of you?

414
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:57,480
Make sure it's. On the screen to the extent possible.

415
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,400
So not hearing any objections we can.

416
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:27,530
See how this relation between the initial and final entropy is stacks up against what we require on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.

417
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:32,450
The statement that the entropy can never decrease as time passes.

418
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:40,280
And in particular these three stages each happen at subsequent moments in time as time is passing.

419
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:50,900
So that means that the initial energy, so the initial entropy we start off with before doing any of these manipulations.

420
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:56,510
Entropy is that extensive quantity that adds across independent subsystems.

421
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:04,190
We know that this can never decrease when those two subsystems are brought together into that system of Mega C.

422
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:11,860
With. The combined energy.

423
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:17,300
AEA plus eps that's a shorthand for is second stage in the process.

424
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:27,650
And then the third stage there can again be no further decrease as the two subsystems are re isolated with their new energies,

425
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,070
their new enterprise and their new temperatures.

426
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:42,100
This is s of e be prime again, adding across those two independent subsystems that are now isolated from each other.

427
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,740
This last inequality actually turns out to be inequality.

428
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:57,880
But the argument for that is not not crucial today.

429
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:02,310
And something I can leave for you to go through if you want to see it, basically.

430
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:08,720
In order to show that this less than her equals two is in fact an equals two,

431
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:18,560
you have to consider all the possible values that E Prime and EB Prime can take and compare that to the possible values in the combined system.

432
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:25,280
We will revisit this in a week or two in a different context, but the same sort of argument.

433
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:36,350
So we don't need to go through it right now. What these inequalities tell us when combined with the Taylor expansion that we had, is that the sum?

434
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:54,250
SBA and EPI for the initial enterprise has to be less than or equal to the sum in the final stage, which we approximated as the initial plus delta.

435
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:00,670
I should put both A and B in here separately.

436
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,010
So that is SBA there.

437
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:19,040
This is SVP. Plus the contribution from the leading term of the Taylor expansion relating the temperature change to the change in energy.

438
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,560
So there is a significant simplification.

439
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:37,370
All of the starting point cancels out and we end up with just these two terms remaining and required to be greater than or equal to zero.

440
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:50,870
And if we then. And the other condition we had from the first law that Delta EB is equal and opposite to Delta EPA.

441
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:59,180
We get delta A. Over each of the temperatures with a relative negative sign.

442
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:05,270
And we're looking here at the larger than or equal to sign of zero.

443
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:24,530
And we can pull out the overall Delta IPA and just have in parentheses one over to minus one over TB that is non-negative and in general positive.

444
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,739
We can see what this implies for energy flow and heat exchange.

445
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:37,170
So. Based on this condition, there are three situations that are possible.

446
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:51,630
So consider first, if we started off in that initial stage or system, A had a greater energy than system B, So what does that imply?

447
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:59,340
If TA is greater than TB, then what? Over to is less than one over TB just taking the inverse.

448
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,630
So a larger quantity is being subtracted from a smaller positive one and giving an overall negative sign in the parentheses.

449
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:16,140
So to keep the product greater than or equal to zero, we require that the energy flow.

450
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:24,240
Is strictly positive. So the change in energy sorry, it is strictly negative.

451
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,900
That's negative. That's negative. The negative signs cancel the product and we get something positive.

452
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:42,710
So sorry to misspeak. So what delta Eaé less than zero means is that energy is flowing.

453
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,440
From system A into system B.

454
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:53,140
And in this case, we noted that system A is the hotter one.

455
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,979
And system B was the colder one to start off with.

456
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:11,590
So this is exactly what we would expect every day if we have a part of the whole system that are brought together and allowed to exchange energy.

457
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,800
Energy flows from the hotter one to the colder one. And this means that.

458
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,399
Relative to the initial temperature,

459
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:34,360
to the final to prime is reduced and relative to the initial temperature to be the final temperature to be prime is increased.

460
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:43,180
So the two temperatures start off at these different values and meet at least closer to the middle.

461
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:49,210
Not necessarily exactly in the middle, depending on the details of the system, but they are.

462
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,240
Going in the right direction that we would expect.

463
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:05,420
So there's nothing surprising here from the micro canonical ensemble, nothing like the negative temperatures we saw before the break.

464
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:15,360
And we can repeat this for, you know, another case where System B was the colder one in general or sort of the colder one sorry,

465
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,440
system A was the colder one initially and B was hotter.

466
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:30,500
So here again, inverting the temperatures A and B we have a larger one over to from which a smaller one over TB is subtracted.

467
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:40,790
So the factor in parentheses is positive. In order to have the overall product be positive, the energy flow has to be positive as well.

468
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:45,410
So energy is flowing into system A out of system B.

469
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:53,650
But that system be that energy is flowing out of is now the one that initially was hotter.

470
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,600
So this qualitative statement about the energy flow is identical.

471
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:08,650
So I'll just put some dyno marks there. The only change is that System B is the hotter one, and system A is the colder one.

472
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,600
So again, energy flowing from hot to cold.

473
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:17,320
Balancing out to some extent the temperatures between them.

474
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:29,260
Then finally, the only other possibility is the very special case where the initial temperatures were exactly equal.

475
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:41,750
So in that case. This is something we can't actually say anything about from inequalities, but from.

476
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:48,070
The more general situation we have.

477
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,549
Ahead. We know that there is no net energy flow in this case.

478
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,270
The temperatures remain equal.

479
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:05,120
And this is the special case, the special situation where these inequalities less than or equal to you turn into exactly equalities.

480
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:19,980
So that is. The second check of how the temperature behaves in the microeconomic ensemble of this case,

481
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:27,629
showing a sensible behaviour and not leading to any divergence or negative temperatures.

482
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:32,850
Are there? Questions about it or about my canonical ensemble in general?

483
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:36,620
Go ahead. I just finished how you covered it.

484
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:47,750
Don't you think? Yeah. That is hiding on the previous page of this calculation that that's not the previous page.

485
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:57,000
And how things got disordered.

486
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:09,810
So when we were defining the final energy in terms of the initial energy, we knew that if so, the overall energy E plus B is conserved.

487
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:23,910
So if this delta E increases, then Delta EB has to decrease by the same amount in order for the sum of the two subsystems to remain conserved.

488
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:36,300
So that was where that came from. And then that negative sign allows us to simplify the inequality that comes from the second law.

489
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:44,730
Any other questions? I'm pausing.

490
01:07:50,910 --> 01:08:03,059
I'm pausing in part to note a change in direction, as this is the last example, a calculation that we will do for the micro canonical ensemble.

491
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:13,380
In these lectures. We will now return to the sort of initial prompts to consider today,

492
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:26,850
asking How can we arrange a system while still obeying conservation of energy and using that as motivation for introducing a new statistical ensemble?

493
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,810
So a line straight across that page.

494
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:46,600
Noting that. Not only does it complete isolation required by the micro economical setup of conserved internal energy

495
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:54,249
get in the way of us imagining doing any experiments or observation on a micro canonical system.

496
01:08:54,250 --> 01:09:04,510
It's also very unrealistic. Even if we had our black box sitting in the void of intergalactic space,

497
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:11,470
there's still a constant background of microwave photons leftover from the Big Bang that are constantly impinging on it.

498
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:20,530
And no matter how good our insulation is, some of those will eventually tunnel through and exchange energy with the contents of that box.

499
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:28,780
So the Micro Canonical ensemble is a very straightforward direct implementation of conservation of energy, that first law.

500
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:35,230
But it's the sort of situation where a mathematical construct.

501
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:43,340
Departs too far from the real world to be of much use for physics.

502
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:52,380
A more useful alternative. Which is in fact even part of the origin of.

503
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,840
The naming of these different statistical ensembles.

504
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:04,250
Something more useful and more ordinary to consider is what's known as the canonical ensemble.

505
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:09,950
Again, named about 120 years ago by Willard Gibbs.

506
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:18,950
So unlike the micro canonical ensemble, the canonical ensemble is defined to be.

507
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:30,970
Characterised by. Again, two fixed quantities, but no longer the conserved energy.

508
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:37,030
So one of the quantities is now going to be the temperature.

509
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,280
Of the system.

510
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:51,670
So t that becomes the input that is fixed that we want to express some of the express derived quantities in terms of in thermodynamic equilibrium.

511
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:57,620
And as well, we actually keep the. Conserved particle number.

512
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:07,090
So that is a bit of overlap with the micro canonical ensemble and the micro canonical case.

513
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:17,470
We had a constant number of particles and internal energy now going from micro canonical to canonical, we keep the particle number fixed,

514
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:27,820
but instead of demanding exact conservation of energy within the system, we instead fixed the temperature.

515
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:36,070
A immediate question to ask when we say something like this is well, how do we fix the temperature?

516
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,800
We've been talking about temperature so far in terms of the micro canonical definition

517
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:47,860
where it was a derived quantity and a function of the conserved energy and.

518
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:54,620
I will just tell you and build up to a demonstration of this that in the canonical case,

519
01:11:54,620 --> 01:12:04,100
we imagine that our system is constantly exchanging energy with its environment and that thermal contact,

520
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:09,440
that energy exchange is what allows the temperature to be fixed.

521
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:24,140
So we specify for simplicity that the environment of our system is going to be some large external reservoir.

522
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:30,420
Of energy. She is.

523
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:34,860
Sometimes called for short a heat bath.

524
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:48,290
And because this temperature is a intensive quantity, if this large external reservoir in combination with the system of interest,

525
01:12:48,290 --> 01:13:01,080
has some temperature, then we know that looking at the system on its own will keep that temperature in place and fixed by that that reservoir.

526
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:14,870
So more formally, the combined or the combination of our system of interest plus its large external reservoir remains.

527
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,550
Governed by the micro ensemble.

528
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:30,500
And if we want to sort of reduce this to a trivial case, we can say that our external reservoir is the entire universe.

529
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:34,040
Our system is able to exchange energy with that,

530
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:40,880
but the overall energy in the whole universe is constant as required by that micro canonical ensemble.

531
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:53,720
So if we call our system Omega, we can see that it is being combined with so a direct product with the.

532
01:13:55,060 --> 01:14:04,510
System of the reservoir recalling the definitions of these state spaces omega as the set of all possible states,

533
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,720
the system on its own can have or the reservoir can have.

534
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:20,200
Each one is fluctuating independently, so you get a product between those two that defines the overall set of all states for the combined system,

535
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:25,690
plus reservoir, potentially the entire universe of which we want to look at a small sub system.

536
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:41,089
And I will just put. Subscripts total you for total on everything having to do with that combination of system and reservoir.

537
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:49,760
So the total energy as an extensive quantity just adds across the system and the reservoir.

538
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:58,580
And thanks to that thermal contact, both of the individual energy is being added.

539
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:04,540
The energy in the system or the energy use of rest of the reservoir can each

540
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:08,450
fluctuate so long as they fluctuate like that in tandem with the negative side,

541
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,950
equal and opposite, so that the overall energy is conserved.

542
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:19,460
And as. This energy for our system is fluctuating.

543
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:28,360
Because we have specified that the reservoir is large. These fluctuations only have a very small effect.

544
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:35,900
I want to spell that with E! So this energy can fluctuate without changing.

545
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:41,410
The intensive temperature that the system inherits.

546
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:48,900
From being part of. The universe or.

547
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:53,570
From being in contact with this large civil reservoir.

548
01:15:55,070 --> 01:16:00,590
So any objections to this set up so far?

549
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,160
One thing you might be wondering about this is does it actually get us anything?

550
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,530
Because we are talking about a system,

551
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:25,930
but we still have to define it in a way that is embedded into a micro canonical universe with conservation of energy across the system,

552
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:36,130
plus this reservoir combined. So we have a micro canonical set up kind of wrapping around this definition of a canonical fixed temperature system.

553
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:48,370
And the way we can benefit from this exercise is by actually showing that the details of the reservoir that fix the temperature

554
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:56,020
don't actually matter and in fact cannot be known from the perspective of the system we are actually interested in.

555
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:05,200
So that's what we will start doing today and possibly finish or possibly have to wrap up Tuesday morning.

556
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:13,870
So that is our next goal. We need to show that the.

557
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:18,940
Details of what exactly this reservoir is.

558
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:29,330
Don't matter. They cannot be. Determined or deduced from the perspective of the system apart from.

559
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:37,690
Being away to fix this intensive temperature. And when those details don't matter, that this is the way that.

560
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:47,680
We can consider a system on its own governed by the micro canonical sorry governed by the canonical ensemble.

561
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:53,980
Moving away from. The micro canonical case.

562
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:17,620
So the traditional way of showing that something doesn't matter is to introduce some sensible nonsense for what it looks like.

563
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:22,060
How it behaves carry out the calculation using that particular onslaughts,

564
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:28,000
and then show that all of the information in that order that drops out of the final answer,

565
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:36,850
which allows us to logically deduce that the form of the hazards we started with does not matter in the first place.

566
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:56,700
That was irritating. So hopefully we are back now and so it all starts is just, you know, an educated guess for what this reservoir might look like.

567
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:09,240
And in order to guarantee that we have a physically sensible reservoir that is realistic

568
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:17,580
and not hiding anything special that would cause this logical argument to break down.

569
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:25,370
We will. Allow or we will take this reservoir.

570
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:31,210
Just to be a bunch of copies of the system we are interested in.

571
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:38,620
So a large number of copies or what are traditionally called replicas labelled

572
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:44,560
by our of the system omega that we are interested in in the first place.

573
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:51,860
So this is known as. The replica trick.

574
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:02,250
We assume that any system we want to analyse is a system worth analysing,

575
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:09,450
and by taking the reservoir to be copies of that, we guarantee that it is also just as sensible as the system itself.

576
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:22,650
And by specifying that the total number of replicas is very large, we obtain the large external reservoir that can fix the temperature.

577
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:27,640
For just a small subsystem within it.

578
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:40,660
We further should specify that all of these are copies of the system, one from the system itself and are minus one from these replicas.

579
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:47,170
They are all in thermal contacts, able to exchange energy with each other.

580
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,380
And they are all in thermodynamic equilibrium.

581
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:05,910
And it is sometimes stated as the zeroth law of thermodynamics that thermodynamic equilibrium is a transitive property.

582
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:16,110
If two systems are both in thermodynamic equilibrium and in thermal contact with each other and the overall system is also in somewhat in equilibrium.

583
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:21,720
Basically what you would expect, but it can be mathematically formalised.

584
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:29,460
So what this gives us is the total energy for the system plus the reservoir.

585
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,709
We had that. Defined as.

586
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:40,100
So the reservoir is now are minus one copies of the system,

587
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:53,299
which we can label with a subscript given by a lowercase our running from one to r the energy in replica r is s of our animal up to

588
01:21:53,300 --> 01:22:03,620
get the total and say that one of them say e So Capital R is the energy for the system of interest that is now no longer conserved.

589
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:20,600
We can also, in addition to working in terms of these individual replicas, we can think about the possible micro states that each replica can take.

590
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:23,990
That is the system that we are interested in in the first place.

591
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:33,050
And I will use a different subscript to refer to the energy of a particular micro state.

592
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:41,330
So east of I. So this is the energy.

593
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:47,440
Of. The corresponding micro state omega sub i.

594
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:55,140
Which is one of the states in the set of states in our system that we are interested in.

595
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:59,340
And just as a reminder, this this energy now is.

596
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:08,930
No longer. Conserved, referring just to a single replica our system of interest rather than the whole.

597
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:19,080
Combination of system plus reservoir. So.

598
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:28,400
We can look at a simple example of.

599
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,590
This idea. So this is maybe the simplest possible.

600
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:42,849
So what an epic system we can imagine. I get a spin system and we just say, let's consider an equals two.

601
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:48,100
We only have two spins in our system and take the.

602
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:54,740
A copy of the system here outlined in red to be the omega that we are interested in,

603
01:23:55,970 --> 01:24:03,060
which has now one of four microstates for these and equal to systems.

604
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:09,799
So the micro states that we have are both of the spins pointing up the left spin,

605
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:15,770
pointing up in the right spin, pointing down vice versa, and then everything pointing down.

606
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:28,010
And the eight replicas that we have just in this picture for illustration are all falling in one of those four micro states.

607
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:34,850
So we can organise calculations either in terms of the nine copies of the system.

608
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:39,980
So here are equals nine, that is one system plus eight replicas.

609
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:51,200
We can count those or we can organise calculations in terms of the four micro states that we have for each of those individual copies of the system.

610
01:24:56,230 --> 01:25:04,690
And in order to simplify the process of going back and forth between those two different ways of organising the.

611
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:20,470
Information that we have, we can. Connect the replica accounting to the micro states by defining what is called the occupation number.

612
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:29,150
So you'll call this end supply. So it has an index running over micro states.

613
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:39,490
And what this is defined to be. Is the number of replicas.

614
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:48,160
That have adopted this micro state omega sub i.

615
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:55,889
At the particular point in time where we look at the system plus its reservoir and get

616
01:25:55,890 --> 01:26:04,860
an overall combined micro state for that total combined system plus reservoir setup.

617
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:22,089
So. What this means and how this allows us to connect micro states to replicas is that if we sum over all of the micro

618
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:30,100
states out of our small system of interest omega or now we will assume that this is a nice finite countable sum.

619
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:38,319
It can be generalised to the continuous case, but if we sum over the occupation numbers and what does that give us?

620
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:44,410
Each term in the sum is the number of replicas that adopt the corresponding micro states.

621
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:48,760
If we some of our own micro states, we better account for all of the replicas.

622
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:56,590
So the sum of occupation numbers is the total number of replicas, including the system itself.

623
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:03,400
And we can, for a concrete illustration, look at.

624
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:09,310
This simple example. Nine replicas with four microstates.

625
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:15,850
And compute the occupation numbers for each of these four microstates.

626
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:25,130
So I see two. Copies of our to spend system that are in this first micro states with everything pointed up.

627
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,180
Four and up on the right and down on the left.

628
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:35,040
I see. Again to those two there.

629
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:42,990
For down and up. Well, it's again, I see two top rate and bottom right.

630
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:50,700
And then for both down, I see 1 to 3 replicas in that micro state.

631
01:27:51,150 --> 01:28:03,320
And hopefully if I add those all up the. Some is two, four, six plus three is nine, which is indeed the number of replicas that we should account for.

632
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:12,680
So we have a connection between replicas and micro states through this occupation number.

633
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:21,950
And we can't generalise this if we similarly consider that some of our micro

634
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:28,230
states of the occupation numbers are the number of replicas in each micro states.

635
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:39,530
If we within this sub weight each of these micro states by its corresponding energy piece of I then.

636
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:54,910
This will account for the contributions of every replica to the energy of the overall system, so it better will add up to that e total energy.

637
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:00,229
We started off with the conserved energy of the overall micro canonical setup that

638
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:07,070
combines the system omega plus the reservoir given by the R minus one replicas of omega.

639
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:19,190
And what other thing we can do if we divide both sides of this relation between occupation number and replicas.

640
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:27,680
By the total number of replicas we will have the sum of our microstates and i.e. divided by that constant are.

641
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:36,810
We can rewrite this as some sum over piece of i's, which equals are divided by R, which is one.

642
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,300
And these piece of I's we define to be.

643
01:29:45,620 --> 01:30:03,450
The occupation probability. Which at least at the moment is interpreted as the probability that if we select a random replica out of our total number,

644
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:07,620
we will find it to be in this Microstate, Omega said.

645
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:21,630
So it is a definition of occupation probability related to the replica trick and the specific form of the external reservoir that we have assumed,

646
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:32,690
at least for now. And.

647
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:42,750
So. With this set up.

648
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:55,110
What we want to do is look at the temperature and see how this replica trick has fixed the temperature in a way that we can identify as.

649
01:30:56,270 --> 01:31:05,599
The starting point, the definitional foundation for the system we're interested in Omega and to get to that temperature,

650
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:13,580
we need to consider again the SO from the micro canonical combination of system plus reservoir,

651
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:24,350
we get the temperature out of that by computing the number of micro states for that whole combination of all our copies taking the logarithm of that,

652
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:29,090
taking the derivative, that's our one over temperature of the micro canonical context.

653
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:34,020
So we will start that off and maybe finish on Tuesday.

654
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:43,350
The. Starting point is to note that we having introduced these occupation numbers.

655
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,620
The overall. Combination of.

656
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:55,250
System and reservoir. Is that is this omega total?

657
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:01,040
This is going to be fully specified. By.

658
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,480
Information about these occupation numbers.

659
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:15,380
So the set of occupation numbers running over all micro microstates or equivalently, if we just normalise that by the number of replicas,

660
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:29,330
the occupation probabilities for each micro state and the temperature for this combination of our system and its reservoir.

661
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:42,910
As I was just saying, it's given by the derivative of the total entropy for that total system with respect to the total energy.

662
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:53,310
Of that total system with the constraints at the total number of particles is fixed, and that entropy itself.

663
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:06,640
Is given by the log of the total number of microstates across all of the replicas that we have and again, fixing the total number of particles.

664
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:19,980
So because our system is specified by the occupation numbers, we can expect to that.

665
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:27,380
Or we can basically organise the computation of the number of micro states by considering

666
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:33,860
how many ways there are to get the set of occupation numbers that characterises the system.

667
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:41,840
So you just write that down.

668
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:57,750
We are counting. The ways of arranging the are replicas that we have into the set of and occupation numbers.

669
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:06,520
At specify any given micro states of the overall combined mini replica system.

670
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:15,680
So there is a systematic way to go about this.

671
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:23,540
So we have specified the occupation numbers for Microstates one, two, three and so on.

672
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:31,309
We have and one of these replicas need to have adopted Microstates Omega one at the time.

673
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:38,040
We are looking at it. The number of ways of doing that is our now familiar binomial coefficient.

674
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:45,290
Take the total number of replicas and say that and one of them have to be in that microstate omega one.

675
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:55,670
So that is the number of ways that we can arrange these our replicas to have the proper number of or the proper and one.

676
01:34:56,030 --> 01:35:00,890
But that's just one occupation number out of the whole set.

677
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:07,579
We then have to consider how to take the the number of ways that the remaining

678
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:11,660
or minus and one replicas that have not yet been assigned to a micro state.

679
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:21,200
And two of them will need to have microstate and two sorry microstate omega to the second microstate.

680
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:31,660
So there is a another combination of ways we can assign replicas to Microstate omega two,

681
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:35,270
but we start off with a smaller number that have not yet been assigned.

682
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:43,969
And independent of that, we are now left with our minus and one and two when we go on to micro stage,

683
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:49,340
omega three and so on, up to however many, many micro states that we have.

684
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:57,530
So just in the last 2 minutes here, we can do this calculation.

685
01:35:57,530 --> 01:36:02,920
These binomial coefficients are just. Combinations of.

686
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,880
Factorial is, as we have seen before.

687
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:12,980
So that is that ratio corresponds to the first binomial coefficient.

688
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:19,760
In the second one, we start off with our minus and one factorial and two factorial.

689
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:29,760
And the difference between. And the what we choose and what we choose from and so on.

690
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:44,350
So in three factorial and this are minus and one minus and two now gets and three subtracted from it before the factorial

691
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:53,920
and so on throughout all of the microstates that we have corresponding to these the set of occupation probabilities.

692
01:36:54,580 --> 01:37:00,910
So we can see that this is what's called a telescoping product similar to a telescoping sum,

693
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,659
something you might not have seen before, But the same general principle,

694
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:15,220
every binomial coefficient that we have comes along and cancels out part of the one that came before it until we reach the final micro states.

695
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:26,450
And we only have left or minus every single occupation number, which we know is zero.

696
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:41,010
And I'll remind you that zero factorial is one. So the end result that we will have to take the log of and then differentiate is

697
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:47,610
that the number of microstates in the total system of our replicas is given.

698
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:59,340
By that our factorial divided by the set of occupation numbers, each of them factorial and multiplied together up to the very last one.

699
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:07,200
So we're out of time to finish the temperature calculation today, but this is where we can pick up on Tuesday.

700
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:15,120
And I should let you go at this point and just check to see that the calculation up

701
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:23,339
till now is not causing any concern or since this is the end of the lecture for today,

702
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:27,600
whether you have any broader questions about anything we've seen so far.

703
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:44,600
I'm not hearing anything at the moment.

704
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:48,350
I will stop that recording.
