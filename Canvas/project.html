<p>This is a placeholder to get the assignment deadline on your calendar --- the assignment itself will be available prior to the first computer lab session on Tuesday, 6 February.</p>
<hr />
<p>This assignment will be <strong>due Tuesday, 20 February</strong>.&nbsp; Submit it by file upload here.&nbsp; <strong>Both</strong> your answers to the questions in the assignment and the code that produces your results must be submitted.&nbsp; These can be uploaded in multiple files or in a tar/zip archive, as you prefer.&nbsp; With the exception of Mathematica <code>.nb</code> files, it will be quicker for me to check code submitted in its native format (for example, a <code>.py</code> file for Python code or a <code>.m</code> file for MATLAB code).&nbsp; Anonymous marking is turned on, and I will aim to return feedback by 3 March.</p>
<p>By submitting solutions to this assessment you affirm that you have read and understood the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/tqsd/code-of-practice-on-assessment/appendix_L_cop_assess.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Integrity Policy</a> detailed in Appendix L of the Code of Practice on Assessment. &nbsp;The marks achieved on this assessment remain provisional until they are ratified by the Board of Examiners in June 2024.</p>
