<p>In this computer project you will numerically analyze two types of diffusive behaviour in one-dimensional random walks. &nbsp;After warm-up exercises on pseudo-random numbers and inverse transform sampling, analyzing ordinary diffusion will allow you to verify your numerical results by comparing them with exact analytic predictions based on the law of large numbers and central limit theorem. &nbsp;You will then adapt these verified numerical methods to consider <em>anomalous diffusion</em>, where exact analytic predictions are not available.</p>
<p>There are five exercises below, four of which provide relevant background information in addition to the tasks for you to complete. &nbsp;While the exercises mention some syntax specific to Python, you may use a different programming language if you prefer. &nbsp;<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://tinyurl.com/math327demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This demo</a> illustrates all the Python programming tools needed for the project. &nbsp;For any reasonable programming language, the numerical computations for each exercise should complete in a few minutes or less.</p>
<p>This assignment is <strong>due Tuesday, 20 February</strong>.&nbsp; Submit it by file upload here.&nbsp; <strong>Both</strong> your answers to the questions in the assignment and the code that produces your results must be submitted.&nbsp; These can be uploaded in multiple files or in a tar/zip archive, as you prefer.&nbsp; With the exception of Mathematica <code>.nb</code> files, it will be quicker for me to check code submitted in its native format (for example, a <code>.py</code> file for Python code or a <code>.m</code> file for MATLAB code).&nbsp; Anonymous marking is turned on, and I will aim to return feedback by 3 March.</p>
<p>By submitting solutions to this assessment you affirm that you have read and understood the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/tqsd/code-of-practice-on-assessment/appendix_L_cop_assess.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Integrity Policy</a> detailed in Appendix L of the Code of Practice on Assessment. &nbsp;Use of resources beyond the module materials (for example, asking ChatGPT to help debug your code) must be explicitly referenced in your submissions.&nbsp; Clear and neat presentations of your workings and the logic behind them will contribute to your mark.&nbsp; The marks achieved on this assessment remain provisional until they are ratified by the Board of Examiners in June 2024.</p>
