<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Module overview</strong></span></p>
<p>Along with quantum mechanics and relativity, statistical physics is a central pillar of modern physics.&nbsp; It uses stochastic (probabilistic) techniques to predict the large-scale behaviour that emerges from the microscopic dynamics of <em>many</em> underlying objects --- far more than can possibly be analyzed in complete detail.&nbsp; Applications of statistical physics range from nuclear physics and cosmology to climate science and biophysics, often with outstanding success.</p>
<p>This module covers both foundations and applications of statistical physics.&nbsp; Foundational topics include the concepts of statistical ensembles, the laws of thermodynamics, and derived quantities such as entropy.&nbsp; We will apply these foundations to investigate diffusion, the behaviour of idealized physical systems such as classical and quantum gases, thermodynamic cycles, and phase transitions. &nbsp;In particular, we will use numerical computer programming to investigate diffusion in terms of stochastic processes.&nbsp; <strong>No</strong> prior exposure to quantum mechanics or computer programming is required --- all necessary information on these topics will be provided.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Schedule </strong></span></p>
<p>Most weeks we will have the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lecture at 9:00&ndash;10:00 on Tuesdays in Room 210</li>
    <li>Tutorial at 14:00&ndash;15:00 on Thursdays in Room 103</li>
    <li>Lecture at 11:00&ndash;13:00 on Fridays in Room 210</li>
</ul>
<p>During weeks 2, 3 and 4 (starting 5, 12 and 19 February) we will instead have computer lab sessions to provide opportunities for you to work on the <a title="[MATH327.1] Computer project" href="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/69036/assignments/263364" data-course-type="assignments" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/api/v1/courses/69036/assignments/263364" data-api-returntype="Assignment">computer project</a> discussed further below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer lab at 9:00&ndash;11:00 on Tuesdays in the Central Teaching Lab PC Centre [<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/intranet/timetabling/online-room-catalogue/rooms/ctl-pctc-green.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Room 117, Green Zone</a>]</li>
    <li>Lecture at 11:00&ndash;13:00 on Fridays in Room 210</li>
</ul>
<p>I will use Zoom to record lectures (and lecturey bits of tutorials and computer labs), which also provides a way for anyone off campus or out of town to connect remotely through <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://liverpool-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/91499188829?pwd=R1dPNjZQUDloS2pGVmxNdWFzenFLQT09" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>this link</span></a> (meeting ID 914 9918 8829, passcode Math327!).</p>
<p><strong>Office hours</strong> will take place after each scheduled activity.&nbsp; Most weeks this will be at 10:00 on Tuesdays, 15:00 on Thursdays and 13:00 on Fridays.&nbsp; During weeks 2, 3 and 4 this will instead be at 11:00 on Tuesdays and 13:00 on Fridays.&nbsp; In all cases office hours will be held in Room 123 of the Theoretical Physics Wing, and will also connect to the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://liverpool-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/91499188829?pwd=R1dPNjZQUDloS2pGVmxNdWFzenFLQT09" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Zoom link</span></a> above.&nbsp; Additional office hours can also be scheduled <a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://calendly.com/daschaich/meet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>by appointment</span></a>, and you can always reach me by email at <a href="mailto:david.schaich@liverpool.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">david.schaich@liverpool.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Assessment</strong></span></p>
<p>There will be three in-term assignments.&nbsp; Each accounts for 15% of the module mark, with the remaining 55% coming from the final exam.&nbsp; While the deadlines listed below are not ideal, they have been centrally coordinated within the Department to minimize pile-up across different modules:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a title="[MATH327.1] Computer project" href="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/69036/assignments/263364" data-course-type="assignments" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/api/v1/courses/69036/assignments/263364" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Computer project</a> due on Tuesday, 20 February</li>
    <li><a title="[MATH327.2] First homework" href="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/69036/assignments/263584" data-course-type="assignments" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/api/v1/courses/69036/assignments/263584" data-api-returntype="Assignment">First homework</a> due on Tuesday, 5 March</li>
    <li><a title="[MATH327.3] Second homework" href="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/69036/assignments/263585" data-course-type="assignments" data-published="true" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/api/v1/courses/69036/assignments/263585" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Second homework</a> due on Friday, 26 April</li>
    <li>Two-hour final examination to be centrally scheduled within the 20&ndash;31 May exam period</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a 17:00 deadline for each assignment has also been centrally coordinated, I won't apply late penalties until the start of the following day.</p>
